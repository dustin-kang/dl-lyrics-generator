"prelude/
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start.
hey tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
My life will pass me by if I don't
open up my eyes
Well its fine by me.
so wake me up when its all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost.
so wake me up when its all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost.
interlude/
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance
to travel the world
I don't have any plans.
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize
so wake me up when its all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost.
so wake me up when its all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost...

"You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us
Another start
You fade away

Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
alive

Where are you now
Where are you now

Where are you now
Was it all in my fantasy
Where are you now
Were you only imaginary

Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea

Where are you now
Another dream
The monster’s running wild inside of me
I’m faded

I’m faded
So lost, I’m faded
I’m faded
So lost, I’m faded

These shallow waters, never met
What I needed
I’m letting go
A deeper dive

Eternal silence of the sea
I’m breathing
Alive

Where are you now
Where are you now
Under the bright, but faded lights
You set my heart on fire

Where are you now
Where are you now

Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea

Where are you now
Another dream
The monster’s running wild inside of me
I’m faded

I’m faded
So lost, I’m faded
I’m faded
So lost, I’m faded",Alan Walker,Faded
"Oh-woah
Woah-oh-oh
Woah
Like a moth to a flame
I'll pull you in, I pulled you back to
What you need initially
It's just one call away
And you'll leave him, you're loyal to me
But this time, I let you be
'Cause he seems like he's good for you
And he makes you feel like you should
And all your friends say he's the one
His love for you is true
But does he know 
you call me when he sleeps?
But does he know the pictures 
that you keep?
But does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, 
does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies
Yeah
You should be with him, 
I let you go from time
You should stay with him
'Cause he seems like he's good for you
And he makes you feel like you should
And all your friends say he's the one
His love for you is true (Hey)
But does he know 
you call me when he sleeps? (No, no)
But does he know the pictures 
that you keep? (Oh)
But does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, 
does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies
Right here with me, babe
Where it truly lies

Where it truly lies
In my heart

"Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No, I can't stop

So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You, look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay, and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
moved to the city in a broke down car and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No, I can't stop

How much you wanna risk?

"Take a seat
Right over there
Sat on the stairs

Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare
And I'm unaware

Of just how we got,
into this mess
Got so aggressive

I know we meant
All good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I can't just let you go

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle

Take a step
Back for a minute
Into the kitchen

Floors are wet
Taps are still running
Dishes are broken

How did we get,
into this mess
Got so aggressive

I know we meant
All good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle

Looking at you I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless my objection

And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just
Come over, pull me in just...

"[Verse 1: Simon Aldred]
Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated

[Pre-Chorus: Simon Aldred]
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

[Chorus: Simon Aldred]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

[Verse 2: Simon Aldred]
We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If theres love in this life we're unstoppable
No we can't be defeated

[Chorus: Simon Aldred]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around",Justin Caruso,No Eyes On Me

"Hey, once upon a younger year
 When all our shadows disappeared
 The animals inside came out to play
 Hey, when face to face with all our fears
 Learned our lessons through the tears
 Made memories we knew would never fade

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let it slip away
 He took me in his arms, I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.
 My father told me when I was just a child
 These are the nights that never die
 My father told me



 When thunder clouds start pouring down
 Light a fire they cant put out
 Carve your name into those shinning stars
 He said, Go venture far beyond these shores.
 Dont forsake this life of yours.
 Ill guide you home no matter where you are.

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let this slip away.
 When I was just a kid I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.

 These are the nights that never die

And we grow after heavy rains

Nothing good ever comes for free

but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, 
but I'm already here
And now, the dudes are lining up 
cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick em to the curb unless 
they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

Now, now, we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Don't be blind

Want you to share that

Cupid in a line
Arrow got your name on it, oh yeah
Don't miss out on a love
And regret yourself on it, oh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it's yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh

When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you

"[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

'Causе I still got these feelings for you, darling
Hitting me like waves right in my chest
In another life, if we start over
When the stars align, I'll meet you then
In another life


I heard when it's real love
It'll come back when you let it go
And baby, all this distance
It's only made my feelings grow

I still got your name on the tip of my tongue
And I still got your face on the lock on my phone
I know we both decided to leave it alone
And we probably shouldn't

In another life, if you came over
We'd say all the things we wish we said
In another life, maybe we're older
We won't have to lose this love again
'Cause I still got these feelings for you, darling
Hitting me like waves right in my chest
In another life, if we start over
When the stars align, I'll meet you then
In another life

Come over, come over, come over
In another life
Come over, come over, come over
In another life if you came over
We'd say all the things we wish we said
In another life, in another life","220 Kid, LANY",Stupid Feelings
"We're a thousand miles from comfort, We have travelled land and sea,
But as long as you are with me, There's no place I'd rather be.

I would wait forever, exulted in the scene,
As long as I am with you, My heart continues to beat.

With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, Strolling so casually,
We're different and the same
gave you another name 
Switch up the battery

If you gave me a chance
I would take it
It's a shot in the dark
But I'll make it
Know with all of your heart
You can't shake me
When I am with you
There's no place I'd rather be.

No no no no no
No place I'd rather be

We set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlasting
So nothing's incomplete

It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity.
As long as we're together, there's no place I'd rather be 
With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay, Strolling so casually,
We're different and the same
gave you another name 
Switch up the battery

If you gave me a chance
I would take it
It's a shot in the dark
But I'll make it
Know with all of your heart
You can't shake me
When I am with you
There's no place I'd rather be.

No no no no no
No place I'd rather be

I'm still all alone
How could this be?
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold?
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear

And says that

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear

And says that

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Oh,whisper three words
And I'll come runnin' and I'll
And girl, you know
That I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone

"I know we've been close since we were kids
And you used to swing my way, knock my door, come out to play
You'd tell me everything I'm always listening
To the stories that we made while we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's gеtting louder and the drinks are gеtting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I'm singing hallelujah
I think my shirt would suit ya
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

It happens every time that we go out
Wish that I could walk you home, instead I text you on your phone
Some drunken message that I know that I'll regret
It was simple in the days, when we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's getting louder and the drinks are getting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

"Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go

And if you feel you're sinking, 
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us 
into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, 
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us 
into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go 
(I won't let go, no no, no no no no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope someone come 
and take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know you won't let go

I won't let go, no no, no no no no

And love is the prize

Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated

For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If theres love in this life we're unstoppable
No we can't be defeated

Don't you know that you're toxic  

It's getting late 
To give you up 
I took a sip 
From my devil's cup 
Slowly 
It's taking over me 

Too high 
Can't come down 
It's in the air 
And it's all around 
Can you feel it now 

With a taste of your lips 
I'm on a ride 
You're toxic 
I'm slipping under 
With a taste of poison paradise 
I'm addicted to you 
Don't you know that you're toxic? 
And I love what you do 
Don't you know that you're toxic 

Don't you know that you're toxic 

Taste of my lips, 
l'm on a ride  
You're toxic 
I'm slipping under

Don't you know that you're toxic? 

With a taste of your lips

I been running from the pain
Trying not to feel the same
But it's a shame that we're sinking
See my confidence is shaking
And my heart is feeling vacant
So you try to fill it in

You say 
I can fix the broken in your heart
You're worth saving darling
But I don't know
why you're shooting in the dark
I got faith in nothing

But love pray for me
I never had somebody
So I don't know how to love
Pray for me
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love

I know it's been a while
Cause my memory's on trial
For the way I used to be
My head is running miles
Round in circles and I try
To find the little light in me

You say
I can fix the broken in your heart
You're worth saving darling
But I don't know
why you're shooting in the dark
I got faith in nothing

But love pray for me

"Hey, once upon a younger year
 When all our shadows disappeared
 The animals inside came out to play
 Hey, when face to face with all our fears
 Learned our lessons through the tears
 Made memories we knew would never fade

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let it slip away
 He took me in his arms, I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.
 My father told me when I was just a child
 These are the nights that never die
 My father told me



 When thunder clouds start pouring down
 Light a fire they cant put out
 Carve your name into those shinning stars
 He said, Go venture far beyond these shores.
 Dont forsake this life of yours.
 Ill guide you home no matter where you are.

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let this slip away.
 When I was just a kid I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.

Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?

Body of a god, yeah, hey
But your heart ain't true
I put my life on the line
'Cause I was waiting for you
You told me to show I was true
But you broke my heart into two, ah
I should've read, I should've read from the signs
Everything we had was a lie
Now I'm out here believing love is a crime
But I got a plan
I got to run away (run away), run away from you
Run away (run away), run away from you
I got to run away, run away from you
Run away, run away from you (let's go)
run away, run away
Run away, run away (I got to)

"We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything

Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
And some days I can't tell if my body belongs to me
I love everything
Fire spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
sh
I wanna taste your content
Hold your breath and feel the tension
Devils hide behind redemption
Honesty is a one way gate to hell
I wanna taste consumption
Breathe faster to waste oxygen
Hear the children sing aloud
It's music till the wick burns out
Hush
Just wanna be care free lately, yeah
Just kicking up daisies
Got one too many quarters in my pockets
Count 'em like the four leaf clovers in my locket
Untied laces, yeah
Just tripping on daydreams
Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat
Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep","Frank Walker, MOTi, SHAI",I Wonder (feat. Shai)
"It's a new day, new day, and it's evident
You must have been heaven-sent
Sometimes we should be hesitant, but I'm not at all
Just feelin more confident
Just using my common sense
Just trust in it, I'm lovin it

I can't refuse an offer so benevolent
Can't assume he's gon' use me 
And after he'll never call again
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
This is your day, this is your day

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
Cus I've become brave
As the light of day straight into a cave
To show me the way, that I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave

I am brave, I am brave

I heard him say this thing moving too fast for him
It's a feelin I was straddeling
Foolishly adamant, but It's all in his eyes
Really wish he would let me in
Cus the same way I'm scared of him
I'm scared of being hurt again

It's time to let go, let go of your heart
It's time for a brand new start
Never know, we might never part
Baby don't be afraid, don't be afraid
This is your day, this is your day

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
Cus I've become brave
As the light of day straight into a cave
To show me the way, that I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave

I wouldn't take back anything that I've gone through (no)
I pray for strength for anything that I'm gonna do
Whether joy, or it's pain, I'm still okay (I, I'm still okay)
I'm a be alright cause I'm not afraid
No, I am brave (brave)

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed

"We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought Wow, if I could
take this in a shot right now
I don't think that
we could work this out

Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought
How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted for someone else

If we go down then
we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then

To get away from your parents
You look so proud standing there
with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself
on the internet

Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air
of this small town
On our own cuttin' class
for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past
we were livin' in

If we go down then

They'll say you could do anything

"Wake up in the morning 
feeling like P Diddy (Hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, 
I'm gonna hit this city (Lets go)
Before I leave, brush my 
teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave 
for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Trying on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pulling up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Ain't got a care in world, 
but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, 
but I'm already here
And now, the dudes are lining up 
cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick em to the curb unless 
they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

Now, now, we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Don't stop, make it pop

You break me down

Yeah, you got me

With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits

But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

But I want you to fit in mine, mine


I need a recap
Came through for the night cap
In the S class, and you can't see through the glass
I keep the tint on
To protect the mood
Let me play a song
I need to see you move
You a bad lil thang with a attitude
But this patek on my wrist might change yourview
Reservation, she like Nobu
I can shut the building down
And make a table for two
The way I put it on can't be taboo
I know it's been so long I been waiting on you
Been through this before
Feelings can't ignore
I know what's in store
I need more décor
I thought love and war was impossible
Ain't nothin' stopping you
Ain't nothin' stopping you


Do you see, darling?
Are you listening?
I'm still trying
Maybe I could make you change your ways


Say we kick back
We relapse
Moving too fast, let's recap
Not focused on facts it's a cap
Moving too, fast let's recap
Say we kick back
We relapse
Moving too fast, let's recap
Not focused on facts it's a cap
Moving too, fast let's recap


It's your life, it's your world
I don't mean to interfere
It's your life, it's amazing
But I want you to fit in mine, mine","R3hab, Lukas Graham",Most People (R3HAB VIP Remix)

"I know we've been close since we were kids
And you used to swing my way, knock my door, come out to play
You'd tell me everything I'm always listening
To the stories that we made while we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's gеtting louder and the drinks are gеtting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I'm singing hallelujah
I think my shirt would suit ya
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

It happens every time that we go out
Wish that I could walk you home, instead I text you on your phone
Some drunken message that I know that I'll regret
It was simple in the days, when we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's getting louder and the drinks are getting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

"Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, 
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us 
into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, 
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us 
into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go

I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go

Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope someone come 
and take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know you won't let go

I had hoped you'd see my face
전 바랐었죠 당신이 제 얼굴을 보고

And that you'd be reminded that for me
제게 상기시켜주었으면 했어요..

It isn't over
아직 끝이 아니란 걸요...



Never mind, I'll find someone like you
괜찮아요, 당신 같은 누군가를 찾으면 돼요.

I wish nothing but the best of you too

Don't forget me, I beg
절 잊지 마세요, 제발요.

I remember you said

Sometimes it lasts in love
그 말이 사랑으로 남기도 하지만

But sometimes it hurts instead
이따금 상처가 되기도 해요

Sometimes it lasts in love
그 말이 사랑으로 남기도 하지만

But sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
아시잖아요, 시간이 얼마나 빨리 흐르는지

Only yesterday was the time of our lives
우리가 살아온 시간이 어제가 다 인 것 같아요

We were born and raised in a summer haze
우린 여름 안개 속에서 태어나서 자랐어요

Bound by the surprise of our glory days
눈부신 나날들 속의 놀라움에 빠진 채로..



I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
제가 갑자기 불청객으로 나타나긴 싫지만

But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
전 멀리할 수도 없었고 그러려고 (저 자신과) 싸울 수도 없었어요

Nothing compares,
어느 것과도 비교할 수는 없어요

No worries or cares
걱정도 염려도 마세요

Regrets and mistakes,
후회와 실수들이란게

They're memories made
추억에서 만들어 진 것(만들어진 추억일) 뿐이에요

Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
누가 알았겠어요 추억이란게 이렇게 달콤하고도 씁쓸할지를요?

"This part I do alone
I'll take my lead
I'll take my lead on this road
And I need something to hold
Make me believe in make beliefs
'Cause after the light is it dark
Is it dark all alone
All alone
You are now listening to 103.5 Dawn FFM
You've been in the dark for way too long
It's time to walk into the light
And accept your fate with open arms
Scared? Don't worry

your hand and guide 
you through this painless transition
But what's the rush?

"It's five a.m. my time again
I've soaking up the moon, can't sleep
It's five a.m. my time again
I'm calling and you know it's me
I'm pushing myself further
I'm just trying to feel 
my heartbeat beat (Beat)
I wrap my hands around your neck
You love it when I always squeeze
It's five a.m. and I'm high again
And you can see that I'm in pain
I've fallen into emptiness
I want you 'cause we're both insane
I'm staring into the abyss
I'm looking at myself again
I'm dozing off to R.E.M
I'm trying not to lose my faith
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me
I know you won't let me OD
And if I finally die in peace
Just wrap my body in thеse sheets
And pour out the gasoline
It don't mеan much to me
It's five a.m., I'm nihilist
I know there's nothing after this
Obsessing over aftermaths
Apocalypse and hopelessness
The only thing I understand
Is zero sum of tenderness (Tenderness)
Oh baby, please just hold me close
Make me believe there's more to live
Around, around, around, around we go
In this game called life, we are not free
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me 
(Don't let me go)
I know you won't let me OD

"Momentary nights in your paradise
I need your moments every night
'Cause you make a wrong feel like a right
Open blinded eyes
I don't know what the end is like
But I wanna be there with you

Tell me it's love you're not just craving my touch
Got some things to clean up, we'll be fine
While you face all your fears I promise I'll be right here
When you need me just call anytime
And we can float in the midnight river (Hmm)
We can fly through the moonlit sky (Hmm)
And wе can float in the midnight river
We can fly through thе moonlit sky
For the rest of our lives

Appreciating every magical encounter
That go with insecurities, they don't matter
All of the chatter, I'm in the mix, the batter
Had to play a batter, 'bout to swing and shatter
Any expectation, brand new revelation
Better conversation, with no limitation
Got no time to play it like a station, ayy
You know I'm on the way and I could almost taste the day
Taste the you, give a nigga déjà vu
Welcome back I feel like Ma$e did too, true
Hallelujah to the sky, feel like I died and went to Heaven
It's love and I just hope you get the message

Tell me it's love you're not just craving my touch
Got some things to clean up, we'll be fine
While you face all your fears I promise I'll be right here
When you need me just call anytime

Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life is always with me
The ice inside my veins will never bleed
Every time you try to fix me
I know you'll never find that missing piece
When you cry and say you miss me
I lie and tell you that I'll never leave

I sacrifice

"The last few months, 
I've been working on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones 
who loved me, baby
I look back now and realize
I remember when I held you
You begged me 
with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Gimme one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like 
I should've loved you all the time
I remember when I held you 
(Held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning 
eyes to stay (Never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
Oh, singing, out of time
Said I had you to myself
But I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
Out of time
Out of time
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, 
you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely 
engulfed in the blissful 
embrace of that little light 
you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, 
forgiven and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever

"There's a fire starting in my heart
제 맘속에 분노의 불꽃이 타오르기 시작했어요

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
활활 타오르면서, 절 어둠 속으로부터 나오게 했어요

Finally, I can see you crystal clear
이제서야 당신이란 인간이 분명히 보이네요

Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your sheet bare
계속 절 팔고 다녀봐요, 저도 당신을 다 까발릴테니까

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
어떻게 당신 모든 걸 가지고 떠나는 지 두고 봐요

Don't underestimate the things that I will do
제가 어떻게 할 지 우습게 생각하지 않는게 (좋을거에요)

제 맘속에 분노의 불꽃이 타오르기 시작했어요

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
활활 타오르면서, 절 어둠 속으로부터 나오게 했어요

The scars of your love remind me of us
사랑의 상처들이 우리를 돌아보게 만들어요

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
그 상처들이 우리가 모든걸 가졌었다고 생각나게 하네요

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
사랑의 상처 들이 절 숨막히게 해요

I can't help feeling
제가 그렇게 느낄 수 밖에 없어요



We could have had it all
우린 전부 가질 수도 있었어요

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
(당신은 절 만나지 않았었으면 생각 할테지만요)

Rolling in the deep
깊이 빠져들면서

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
(눈물이 날거에요, 깊이 빠져들면서)



You had my heart inside of your hand
당신은 제 심장을 손에 쥐고

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Baby, I have no story to be told
제가 당신께 들려 줄 얘기는 없지만

But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
당신에 관한 얘기를 하나 들었고, 난 당신을 화나게 할 작정이에요

Think of me in the depths of your despair
깊은 절망에 빠져 저를 생각해보세요

Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
저 처럼 그 절망 속에서 살아봐요, 당연히 같이 할 생각은 없어요

Throw your soul through every open door

Count your blessings to find what you look for
당신께 주어진 축복을 헤아려봐요, 바라는 무언가를 얻는 축복을...

He ain't never seen it in a dress like this (ah)
He ain't never even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy?
Shut it, save it, keep it, pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
And knowing you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (yeah, yeah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas saying you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of that body-ody, the ass and titties
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you want it, say so

"I look at the time through anxious eyes
Leave it alone they say a watched clock never boils
But I still watch away anyway 
I hold my breath a little longer 
How can I say or do a thing 
When I got so many things
Racing through my head 

Before 4:30 
Before 4:30
Can't do a thing
With her all my brain 

Before 4:30
Before 4:30 
How should i try
To make her mine 

Do I tell her she looks lovely
like a classic movie cliche 
Do I, Do I..
Take you somewhere rich and fancy 
Or a casual cafe darling I do
Darling I
Can't wait to see you today 

I see you lookin at the time
all anxiously
look again and check that yes still 
half past 3 
60 minutes till you meet the one you talkin all about for weeks 

so what you doin
clean your hair
brush your teeth
and don't be nervous when you 
two finally meet
be a gentleman 

you'll be okay
and my god stop lookin at the clock I'll tell you when you gotta leave 

you lookin good
you lookin fresh
shoulder straight head up look ahead
spray this 
chew that 
take this 
and don't forget
Just be yourself when the clock 
says 4 and 30 

go and tell her she looks lovely!!


like a classic movie cliche 

do I take her somewhere rich and fancy?
or a casual cafe darling I do, darling I
can't wait to see you today

"Oh can I explain myself to you
Questions been lurking through my mind
Is it the lover for the time
I've given my heart my joy my soul to you
If it is real I sure can't see
Gotta start lookin' out for me
And in my, my heart won't take no more
I know you say that I don't care
Sometimes my way of life ain't fair
I feel it's sad for me you take the chance
So you are givin' me no choice
I think I must exercise my voice and say
This feeling there's no drug that can compare
You're so cold I can't see your breath I swear
And they told me not to fall in love
Wondering where it all went wrong
You were my poison all along
Late at night I lay awake in tears and pain (Tears and pain)
Askin' my heart for What went wrong (Hey)
Askin' myself What's goin' on
Oh come on we seem to see things eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Somehow I didn't feel the danger (Hey)
And now I'm sleeping with a stranger
To see all these years we flushed them down the drain (Down the drain)
Was that a love we can't promise
Now it's too late for both of us
No regrets for what we lost and what we shared
Maybe tomorrow we'll love again
But until then we'll stay as friends
This feeling there's no drug that can compare
You're so cold I can't see your breath I swear
They told me not to fall in love

"Looking back now, 
I didn't know what it was supposed to be
And it's like raising kids, man
If you weren't raised, 
they don't know how to raise, you know?
I just did the best that 
I could with them because 
they know fuckin' well I love them
But I didn't do the best 
I could — I didn't know what the fuck 
I was doing — I didn't
I will never forget watching 
my mother get 
put in a straightjacket and taken 
out of my home 
when I was only seven years old
She was diagnosed with Dementia 
praecox and put in a mental institution 
leaving my daddy alone 
with me and my little brothеr Lloyd
I later had an evil stepmothеr 
who further cemented the idea 
that I didn't need a mother
Growing up without one had long 
lasting impressions I didn't fully 
understand until much later in life
It bled into my relationships 
with family and those 
I had became romantically involved with
Whenever I got too close to a woman, 
I would cut her off
Part of that was vindictive and partially 
based on fear, 
but it was also totally subconsious

"Oh you heard
What they say
Oh, the more things change
The more they stay the same
Ain't that a shame? (I know it's a shame)
I've been good
For some time
I'd be lying if I said that
You ain't on my mind
Been tryin' to give it some time

Feeling like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say

I can say that loving you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way
I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
Try to understand

Mornin' sun, mornin' high
Oh, I think this haze is for now my best disguise
No need to think about why
What'cha say, starry-eyed
How you love to smile
And watch the clouds reside
Just tryin' to give it some time

Feeling like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say

I can say that loving you is easy

"I think I'm losing my mind

Trying to stay inside the lines

It's like I'm running in place

How you keep staying the same?

Baby, I, I guess I'm something different

And I'm okay with that

I can't fake no more smiles

That shit gon' drive me mad

I'm focused on the future

Don't care 'bout nothin' else

I'm better by myself

I'm better by myself

I don't need no one else

I'm better by myself

Myself

Don't wanna answer questions

Just want your company

It's all good on the surface

Show me what's underneath

I'm not concerned with drama

I left that shit in school

I'm more concerned with commas

Than keeping up with you

Keep that away from me

I put the Heisman up to bad energy

No empathy, especially when the kid off Hennessy

Fake friends to me make my mood go south like Tennessee

Make the fool come out like, ""Who is he?""

I mean, I'm trying to tell y'all

I'm better by myself

I'm better by myself

I don't need no one else

I'm better by myself

Myself

I don't know who to trust

These days everyone's shady

Fool me once, I'm on my own

There is no second time, baby

That's the shit I don't like

Please no yes, no maybes

"Why I love to give you flowers on a Wednesday, 12 dozen roses at your door.

Or even light some candles when you come over for dinner, I wouldn’t mind to light a billion more.

Or how I like to wake up and see you with no make up, I’d still give you a ring the way you are. 

Or stay up on the phone late at night when you’re alone, looking out the window gazing up at stars.

Chorus: 
So if you’re wondering why I do the things that I do, honestly I don’t know what to say.

All these questions and answers, I just like to have her, every moment every single day.

Verse Two:
Why I love to hold you even in the public, you could call it lovely PDA.

I don’t care what city, you could pick out of the 50 states like California in the bay.

Or how I like to take you to church on every Sunday, holding hands together as we pray.

I dont care if people hate, I dont care what people say, cause my love for you will always be the same.

"Lately I`ve had the strangest feeling

With no very reason here to find

Yet the thought of losing you`s been hanging

around my mind

Far more frequently you`re wearing perfume

With you say `No special place to go`

But when I ask, will you be coming back soon

You don`t know, never know

Well, I`m a man of many wishes

Hope my premonition misses

But what I really feel

My eyes won`t let me hide

`Cause they always start to cry

`Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I`ve been staring in the mirror

Very slowly picking me apart

Trying to tell myself I have no reason

with your heart

Just the other night while you were sleeping

I vaguely heard you whisper someone`s name

But, when I asked you other the thoughts you`re keeping

You just said `Nothing`s changed`

Well,I`m a man of many wishes

I hope my premonition misses

what I really feel

My eyes won`t let me hide

`Cause they always start to cry

`Cause this time could mean good bye

Good bye oh~~

Well,I`m a man of many wishes

I hope my premonition misses

what I really feel

My eyes won`t let me hide

최근에 난 이상한 감정을 갖게 되었어요

특별히 명백한 이유는 없지만

당신을 잃을 것 같다는 생각을 떨칠 수 없어요.

내 마음 주위로

요즘 당신은 향수를 자주 사용하는군요

‘어디갈 특별한 이유는 없어' 라고 말하면서

""곧 돌아올 거죠?"" 라고 내가 물으면

당신은 말합니다. 모른다, 절대 모른다고.

난 많은 소원을 가진 남자랍니다

나의 예감이 틀리기를 바라지만

내가 정말 느끼는 것을

나의 눈은 숨기지 못하죠

왜냐면 항상 눈물이 나오니깐

왜냐면 이번에는 아마 당신과 이별을 해야 하니까요

(오 나에게 이야기해 주세요)

최근에 난 거울 속을 들여다 보기 시작했죠

매우 천천히 나를 조각조각 내면서

나 자신에게 무슨 이유가 있다고 말하면서

당신의 마음을 잡지 못한 것은

그대여, 당신이 잠자고 있었던 지난 날 밤에

당신이 희미하게 누군가의 이름을 부르는 것을 들었어요

그러나 내가 당신에게 어떤 생각을 하고 있는 가를 물었을 때

당신은 무심코 말했어요 ‘변한 건 없어!'

난 많은 소원을 가진 남자랍니다

나의 예감이 틀리기를 바라지만

내가 정말 느끼는 것을

Mine (ooh ooh)
You're mine (ooh ooh)
You're mine
Tell me you're mine

Fancy car, ride on my heart
Fancy car, shy? You ain't shy, no
Heart, more than you know
Ours, diamond and gold
The vice, all that we know
The life, diamond and gold
The vice, all that we know
The lights, all that we know
The eyes, all that she knows
The life, all that she'll know",Ne-Yo,So Sick
"Girl you're a river
Of healing
I was certain that I wouldn't last
And you are the answer
To questions
That I didn't know my soul was asking

My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life

'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
I have been broken
And beaten
Yeah the world knows how to break you down
But when pain blurs my vision
I won't worry
Because you always turn it back around 

My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life

'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my Center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
 'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my Center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine 
Too good to be mine 
Got me feeling like it's too good to be 
Too good to be mine",The Weeknd,Die For You
"You're turned in to Dawn FM
The middle of nowhere on your dial
So sit back and unpack
You may be here awhile
Now that all future plans 
have been postponed
And it's time to look back 
on the things you thought you owned
Do you remember them well?
Were you high or just stoned?
And how many grudges 
did you take to your grave?
When you weren't liked or followed, 
how did you behave?
Was it often a dissonant 
chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune 
with the song life was humming?
If pain's living on 
when your body's long gone
And your phantom regret hasn't 
let it go yet
You may not have died in the way 
that you must
All specters are haunted by their 
own lack of trust
When you're all out of time, 
there's nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering
No nations, no race
And Heaven is closer than those 
tears on your face
When the purple rain falls
We are all bathed in it's grace
Heaven's for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here 
when you're not all there yet
But you could be there 
by the end of this song
Where The Weeknd's 
so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on
And if your broken heart's heavy 
when you step on the scale
You'll be lighter than air 
when they pull back the vail
Consider the flowers, 
they don't try to look right
They just open their 
petals and turn to the light
Are you listening real close?
Heaven's not that, it's this
It's the depth of this moment
We don't reach for bliss
God knows life is chaos
But He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind
Train your soul to align
And dance 'til you find that divine boogaloo
In other words
You gotta be Heaven, to see Heaven
May peace be with you",Jeff Bernat,If You Wonder

"Hello, it's me
안녕, 저에요.

I was wondering if after all these years
전 궁금했어요 이 모든 시간이 지나고 나도

You'd like to meet, to go over everything
절 만나서 우리의 모든걸 돌이켜 보고 싶어할지 말이에요

They say that time's supposed to heal ya
시간이 모든걸 치유해 준다고들 하지만

But I ain't done much healing
저는 그러지 못하네요.



Hello, can you hear me?
여보세요, 듣고 있어요?

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
전 우리가 예전에 꿈꾸었던 캘리포니아에 있어요,

When we were younger and free
우리가 더 젊고 자유로웠던 예전에...

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
전 잊었어요 세상이 우리 발밑에 있다고 느끼던 기분이 어땠는지를...

There's such a difference between us and a million miles
우리 사이에는 백만마일 만큼이나 거리가 있어요

지금껏 제가 벌인 모든 것에 대하여 미안하다고

But when I call you never seem to be home
하지만, 그 때마다 당신은 집에 없었어요



Hello from the outside
전화기 너머로 들려오는 Hello

At least I can say that I've tried
적어도 제가 애썼다고 말할 수 있어요.

To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
당신께 상처 줘서 미안하다고 말하기 위해 애썼다고...

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
하지만, 상관 없어요. 더이상 당신은 상처 받지 않을 테니까.



Hello, how are you?
안녕, 잘 지내시죠?

It's so typical of me to talk about myself
늘 이런식으로 내 얘기를 하네요

I'm sorry, I hope that you're well
미안, 당신이 잘 지내시길 바래요



Did you ever make it out of that town
그 마을을 떠난 것이

Where nothing ever happened?
아무일도 일어나지 않아서 인가요?

i just cant get enough of you
its that perfume that you wear
and the way you do your hair
that i love so much
its the simple things you say
and how in bed we play
its the way you kiss my cheek
when you think that Im asleep
i love it so much

Everyday scrubbing it lovin it
crusin freeways in our PJs c
cause thats the fun of it unless
you wear that pretty black dress o yes
catch me in a suit so i can look as good as you
but i dont owell 
with that smile that you wear so well
and the way that you cry in movies
pass you the ball and pass it back to me
beers with the guys 
aint no thing
its your eyes and the simple things
that make this work like it should
when you rock my shirt
o you look so good 
so take my hand n stay as long as you can w the man

Can you tell me what I did wrong?

Though we're not meant to be
Know we were meant to meet
You were a blessing in disguise
We tried to make amends
But God had different plans
I see my future in your eyes
And it's not by your side
It's for the best baby
We're both going places
We need to grow

We were both just a stepping stone
Giving, getting growth
And now it's time to let each other go

Was to be true just to myself

Though we're not meant to be
Know we were meant to meet
You were a blessing in disguise (yeah)
We tried to make amends
But God had different plans
I see my future in your eyes
And it's not by your side
It's for the best baby
We're both going places
We need to grow

Just keep your head held high
No, forever wasn't right
But the future's still so bright
I feel it, I feel it
So keep your head held high
Make that shift inside your mind
Give yourself a little time
To feel it, to feel it

Though we're not meant to be
Know we were meant to meet
You were a blessing in disguise
We tried to make amends
But God had different plans
I see my future in your eyes
And it's not by your side
It's for the best baby
We're both going places
We need to grow
It's for the best baby

"When we're all alone and the night has falled 
And lost in what each other needs 
When the silence echoes our nervous hearts 
And all is just the way we feel 
I can't hide it, shouldn't fight it
Go with instinct  
why deny it
You are all I ever wanted   
So let's run free
And loose ourselves in love
We've never been here before 
So were gonna take our time 
Ooohh We've never been here before 
So were gonna take our time Ooooh
You shy away you was afraid   
To give into something so real 
Allow desire to rule your head 
Get lost in what we feel
You can't hide it shouldn't fight it 
Go with instinct why deny it 
You are all I ever wanted 
So let's run free 
And lose ourselves in love 
We've never been here before 
So were gonna take our time Ooohh

"Would it make you feel better, babe
If I told you I've been feeling things you don't believe in?
Thinking that I'm seeing things
Your heart is in the ground and my head's through the ceiling
All the possibilities
Losing my ability to know what you're feeling

I've been wondering what you think about
Baby you don't tell me so I'm only assuming
You don't think I hear you out
But say you're happy long as I'm giving the time that I'm due and
I could never leave you now
But if you feel like walking out, baby then do it

Well the rain keeps pouring down
Trouble keeps on coming 'round
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)
If you're hiding what you feel
Underneath a bitter pill
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)

I've been searching for the point of it
Moments that we share together losing their meaning
Tell me what the matter is
Feeling like you're fighting me for no fucking reason
Baby take a break from it
Space from all the petty shit should give you healing

Well the rain keeps pouring down
Trouble keeps on coming 'round

I'mma tell you I'm over it)
If you're hiding what you feel
Underneath a bitter pill

The truths of your heart unfolding
I want you to rest in knowing

And love is the prize

In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable

Wednesday my empty arms were open

Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love

"Hey, once upon a younger year
 When all our shadows disappeared
 The animals inside came out to play
 Hey, when face to face with all our fears
 Learned our lessons through the tears
 Made memories we knew would never fade

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let it slip away
 He took me in his arms, I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.
 My father told me when I was just a child
 These are the nights that never die
 My father told me



 When thunder clouds start pouring down
 Light a fire they cant put out
 Carve your name into those shinning stars
 He said, Go venture far beyond these shores.
 Dont forsake this life of yours.
 Ill guide you home no matter where you are.

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let this slip away.
 When I was just a kid I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.

Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?

Can't take it witcha nigga thats my motto
Fuck it, I be on some baller shit
Fuck it, Dolla don't call dem' bitch
Wasted, she done drunk all of it
Kick her to the curb, I'm rude as shit
Like a boom boom boom
Tell a PJ to a boom boom room
Then we flew to Cancun
Banana clip on me, I'd shoot a baboon
And my wrist on cruise, neck on pool, watch on monsoon
So you better make room
Trappin' out a igloo, eskimo room
Bring that ass back like a boom boom boom boom
Bring that ass back like a boom boom boom

"We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything

Just trust in it, I'm lovin it

Can't assume he's gon' use me

Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
Cus I've become brave
As the light of day straight into a cave
To show me the way, that I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave

I am brave, I am brave

I heard him say this thing moving too fast for him
It's a feelin I was straddeling
Foolishly adamant, but It's all in his eyes
Really wish he would let me in
Cus the same way I'm scared of him
I'm scared of being hurt again

It's time to let go, let go of your heart
It's time for a brand new start
Never know, we might never part
Baby don't be afraid, don't be afraid
This is your day, this is your day

To show me the way, that I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave

I wouldn't take back anything that I've gone through (no)
I pray for strength for anything that I'm gonna do
Whether joy, or it's pain, I'm still okay (I, I'm still okay)
I'm a be alright cause I'm not afraid
No, I am brave (brave)

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
Cus I've become brave
As the light of day straight into a cave
To show me the way, that I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave

I am brave","Sigala, Ella Eyre, Meghan Trainor",Just Got Paid (Feat. French Montana)
"We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought Wow, if I could
take this in a shot right now
I don't think that
we could work this out

Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought
How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted for someone else

If we go down then
we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then
we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud standing there
with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself
on the internet

Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air
of this small town
On our own cuttin' class
for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past
we were livin' in

If we go down then
we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then
we go down together
We'll get away with everything

"Wake up in the morning 
feeling like P Diddy (Hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, 
I'm gonna hit this city (Lets go)
Before I leave, brush my 
teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave 
for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Trying on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pulling up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Don't stop, make it pop

Tick tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Ain't got a care in world, 
but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, 
but I'm already here
And now, the dudes are lining up 
cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick em to the curb unless 
they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

Now, now, we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but

It'll come back when you let it go
And baby, all this distance
It's only made my feelings grow

And I still got your face on the lock on my phone

As long as I am with you, My heart continues to beat.

But I'll make it
Know with all of your heart
You can't shake me
When I am with you
There's no place I'd rather be.

No no no no no
No place I'd rather be

We set out on a mission to find our inner peace Make it everlasting
So nothing's incomplete

It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity.

I'm still all alone
How could this be?
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold?
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away

And says that

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear

And says that

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Oh,whisper three words
And I'll come runnin' and I'll
And girl, you know
That I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone",David Guetta,2U (Feat. Justin Bieber)

That magic in your pants, its making me blush (for sure)

Looking for some trouble tonight
Take my hand ill show you the wild side
Like its the last night of our lives
Well keep dancing till we die

I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while youre here in my arms,
Lets make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

"I know we've been close since we were kids
And you used to swing my way, knock my door, come out to play
You'd tell me everything I'm always listening
To the stories that we made while we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's gеtting louder and the drinks are gеtting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I'm singing hallelujah
I think my shirt would suit ya
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

It happens every time that we go out
Wish that I could walk you home, instead I text you on your phone
Some drunken message that I know that I'll regret
It was simple in the days, when we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's getting louder and the drinks are getting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober

What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go

Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us 
into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, 
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us

전 바랐었죠 당신이 제 얼굴을 보고

And that you'd be reminded that for me

You know how the time flies
아시잖아요, 시간이 얼마나 빨리 흐르는지

Only yesterday was the time of our lives
우리가 살아온 시간이 어제가 다 인 것 같아요

We were born and raised in a summer haze
우린 여름 안개 속에서 태어나서 자랐어요

Bound by the surprise of our glory days
눈부신 나날들 속의 놀라움에 빠진 채로..

추억에서 만들어 진 것(만들어진 추억일) 뿐이에요

Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
누가 알았겠어요 추억이란게 이렇게 달콤하고도 씁쓸할지를요?



Never mind, I'll find someone like you
괜찮아요, 당신 같은 누군가를 찾으면 돼요.

I wish nothing but the best for you, too
당신이 행복하기만 바랄게요

Don't forget me, I beg
절 잊지 마세요, 제발요.

I remember you said
당신이 말했던 걸 기억해요

Sometimes it lasts in love
그 말이 사랑으로 남기도 하지만

But sometimes it hurts instead
이따금 상처가 되기도 해요

"This part I do alone
I'll take my lead
I'll take my lead on this road
And I need something to hold
Make me believe in make beliefs
'Cause after the light is it dark
Is it dark all alone
All alone
You are now listening to 103.5 Dawn FFM
You've been in the dark for way too long
It's time to walk into the light
And accept your fate with open arms

your hand and guide

"It's five a.m. my time again
I've soaking up the moon, can't sleep
It's five a.m. my time again
I'm calling and you know it's me
I'm pushing myself further
I'm just trying to feel 
my heartbeat beat (Beat)
I wrap my hands around your neck
You love it when I always squeeze
It's five a.m. and I'm high again
And you can see that I'm in pain
I've fallen into emptiness
I want you 'cause we're both insane
I'm staring into the abyss
I'm looking at myself again
I'm dozing off to R.E.M
I'm trying not to lose my faith
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me
I know you won't let me OD
And if I finally die in peace
Just wrap my body in thеse sheets
And pour out the gasoline
It don't mеan much to me
It's five a.m., I'm nihilist
I know there's nothing after this
Obsessing over aftermaths
Apocalypse and hopelessness
The only thing I understand
Is zero sum of tenderness (Tenderness)
Oh baby, please just hold me close
Make me believe there's more to live
Around, around, around, around we go
In this game called life, we are not free
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me 
(Don't let me go)
I know you won't let me OD 
(Don't you let me go)
And if I finally die in peace (Oh yeah)
Just wrap my body in these sheets
And pour out the gasoline
It don't mean much to me","Joel Corry, Raye, David Guetta",BED
"Momentary nights in your paradise
I need your moments every night
'Cause you make a wrong feel like a right
Open blinded eyes
I don't know what the end is like
But I wanna be there with you

Tell me it's love you're not just craving my touch
Got some things to clean up, we'll be fine
While you face all your fears I promise I'll be right here
When you need me just call anytime
And we can float in the midnight river (Hmm)
We can fly through the moonlit sky (Hmm)
And wе can float in the midnight river
We can fly through thе moonlit sky
For the rest of our lives

Appreciating every magical encounter
That go with insecurities, they don't matter
All of the chatter, I'm in the mix, the batter
Had to play a batter, 'bout to swing and shatter
Any expectation, brand new revelation
Better conversation, with no limitation
Got no time to play it like a station, ayy
You know I'm on the way and I could almost taste the day
Taste the you, give a nigga déjà vu
Welcome back I feel like Ma$e did too, true
Hallelujah to the sky, feel like I died and went to Heaven
It's love and I just hope you get the message

Tell me it's love you're not just craving my touch
Got some things to clean up, we'll be fine
While you face all your fears I promise I'll be right here
When you need me just call anytime
And we can float in the midnight river
We can fly through the moonlit sky (Hmm)

"I was born in a city
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life is always with me
The ice inside my veins will never bleed
Every time you try to fix me
I know you'll never find that missing piece
When you cry and say you miss me
I lie and tell you that I'll never leave
But
I sacrifice
Your love for more of the night
I try to put up a fight
Can't tie me down
I don't want to sacrifice
For your love
I try
I don't want to sacrifice
But I love my time
I hold you through the toughest parts
Whеn you feel like it's the end

'Cause life is still worth living
I can break you down and pick you up
And fuck like we are friends

Don't be out here catching feelings

"The last few months, 
I've been working on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones 
who loved me, baby
I look back now and realize
I remember when I held you
You begged me 
with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Gimme one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like 
I should've loved you all the time
I remember when I held you 
(Held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning 
eyes to stay (Never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
Oh, singing, out of time
Said I had you to myself
But I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
Out of time
Out of time
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, 
you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely 
engulfed in the blissful 
embrace of that little light 
you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, 
forgiven and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever
Here's thirty minutes of easy 
listening to some slow tracks

"There's a fire starting in my heart
제 맘속에 분노의 불꽃이 타오르기 시작했어요

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
활활 타오르면서, 절 어둠 속으로부터 나오게 했어요

Finally, I can see you crystal clear
이제서야 당신이란 인간이 분명히 보이네요

Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your sheet bare
계속 절 팔고 다녀봐요, 저도 당신을 다 까발릴테니까

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
어떻게 당신 모든 걸 가지고 떠나는 지 두고 봐요

Don't underestimate the things that I will do
제가 어떻게 할 지 우습게 생각하지 않는게 (좋을거에요)

제 맘속에 분노의 불꽃이 타오르기 시작했어요

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
활활 타오르면서, 절 어둠 속으로부터 나오게 했어요

The scars of your love remind me of us
사랑의 상처들이 우리를 돌아보게 만들어요

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
그 상처들이 우리가 모든걸 가졌었다고 생각나게 하네요

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
사랑의 상처 들이 절 숨막히게 해요

I can't help feeling
제가 그렇게 느낄 수 밖에 없어요



We could have had it all
우린 전부 가질 수도 있었어요

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
(당신은 절 만나지 않았었으면 생각 할테지만요)

Rolling in the deep
깊이 빠져들면서

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
(눈물이 날거에요, 깊이 빠져들면서)



You had my heart inside of your hand
당신은 제 심장을 손에 쥐고

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
(당신은 절 만나지 않았었으면 생각 할테지만)

And you played it, to the beat
제 마음을 조종했죠, 심장박동에 맞춰서...

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
(눈물이 날거에요, 깊이 빠져들면서)



Baby, I have no story to be told
제가 당신께 들려 줄 얘기는 없지만

But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
당신에 관한 얘기를 하나 들었고, 난 당신을 화나게 할 작정이에요

Think of me in the depths of your despair
깊은 절망에 빠져 저를 생각해보세요

Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
저 처럼 그 절망 속에서 살아봐요, 당연히 같이 할 생각은 없어요

제 마음을 조종했죠, 심장박동에 맞춰서...

Throw your soul through every open door
문이 열려 있다면 당신의 영혼을 버리세요

Count your blessings to find what you look for
당신께 주어진 축복을 헤아려봐요, 바라는 무언가를 얻는 축복을...

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
제 슬픔을 소중한 금으로 돌려놓으세요

You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

"Tell me what you really like
Baby I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

You've been scared of love
and what it did to you
You don't have to run, 
I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch

You are not the single type
So baby, this the perfect time

And faded off this touch
You don't need a lonely night
So baby, I can make it right
You just got to let me try
To give you what you want

We're fighting
'Cause I used to be the one who was lying
Oh, lying

'Cause I wanna keep you close
I don't wanna lose my spot

Oh, or not

"I look at the time through anxious eyes
Leave it alone they say a watched clock never boils
But I still watch away anyway 
I hold my breath a little longer 
How can I say or do a thing 
When I got so many things
Racing through my head 

Before 4:30 
Before 4:30
Can't do a thing
With her all my brain 

Before 4:30
Before 4:30 
How should i try
To make her mine 

Do I tell her she looks lovely
like a classic movie cliche 
Do I, Do I..
Take you somewhere rich and fancy 
Or a casual cafe darling I do
Darling I
Can't wait to see you today 

I see you lookin at the time
all anxiously
look again and check that yes still 
half past 3 
60 minutes till you meet the one you talkin all about for weeks 

so what you doin
clean your hair
brush your teeth
and don't be nervous when you 
two finally meet
be a gentleman 

you'll be okay
and my god stop lookin at the clock I'll tell you when you gotta leave 

you lookin good
you lookin fresh
shoulder straight head up look ahead
spray this 
chew that 
take this 
and don't forget
Just be yourself when the clock 
says 4 and 30 

go and tell her she looks lovely!!


like a classic movie cliche 

do I take her somewhere rich and fancy?
or a casual cafe darling I do, darling I
can't wait to see you today
  
So I told her she looks lovely
like a classic movie cliche 

and I took her to the park
and talked while counting all of the stars 

and when we said goodnight
she left me with 5 little words     
""Can't wait for next time""

"Oh can I explain myself to you
Questions been lurking through my mind
Is it the lover for the time
I've given my heart my joy my soul to you
If it is real I sure can't see
Gotta start lookin' out for me
And in my, my heart won't take no more
I know you say that I don't care
Sometimes my way of life ain't fair
I feel it's sad for me you take the chance
So you are givin' me no choice
I think I must exercise my voice and say
This feeling there's no drug that can compare
You're so cold I can't see your breath I swear
And they told me not to fall in love
Wondering where it all went wrong
You were my poison all along
Late at night I lay awake in tears and pain (Tears and pain)
Askin' my heart for What went wrong (Hey)
Askin' myself What's goin' on
Oh come on we seem to see things eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Somehow I didn't feel the danger (Hey)
And now I'm sleeping with a stranger
To see all these years we flushed them down the drain (Down the drain)
Was that a love we can't promise
Now it's too late for both of us
No regrets for what we lost and what we shared
Maybe tomorrow we'll love again
But until then we'll stay as friends
This feeling there's no drug that can compare
You're so cold I can't see your breath I swear
They told me not to fall in love
Wondering where it all went wrong
You were my poison all along (Yeah)
Poison all long, ooh-yeah (Oh-oh-ooh)

"Looking back now, 
I didn't know what it was supposed to be
And it's like raising kids, man
If you weren't raised, 
they don't know how to raise, you know?
I just did the best that 
I could with them because 
they know fuckin' well I love them
But I didn't do the best 
I could — I didn't know what the fuck 
I was doing — I didn't
I will never forget watching 
my mother get 
put in a straightjacket and taken 
out of my home 
when I was only seven years old
She was diagnosed with Dementia 
praecox and put in a mental institution 
leaving my daddy alone 
with me and my little brothеr Lloyd
I later had an evil stepmothеr 
who further cemented the idea 
that I didn't need a mother
Growing up without one had long 
lasting impressions I didn't fully 
understand until much later in life
It bled into my relationships 
with family and those 
I had became romantically involved with
Whenever I got too close to a woman, 
I would cut her off
Part of that was vindictive and partially 
based on fear, 
but it was also totally subconsious

"Old memories, they don't go away
They show up before you leave
And disappear when you wish they'd stay
No heart is immune, no secret is kept
Yeah, they only get stronger with age
Old memories, they don't go away
Old love songs, they don't ever end
Just when you think that you've moved on
They remind you, you ain't over it
Sneak in the dark, creep in your bed
Playing over the loss in your head
Old love songs, thеy don't ever end
It's a problеm I'm telling ya
Makes you temperamental
It takes all of the best of ya

Old photographs never fade away
They're just frozen there in time
Locked in pretty picture frames
Bridges we burn (Yeah), 
the once happiness (Yeah)
It's a black and white that you can't change
Old photographs never fade away
It's a problem I'm telling ya

"Oh you heard
What they say
Oh, the more things change
The more they stay the same
Ain't that a shame? (I know it's a shame)
I've been good
For some time
I'd be lying if I said that
You ain't on my mind
Been tryin' to give it some time

Feeling like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say

I can say that loving you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way
I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
Try to understand

Mornin' sun, mornin' high
Oh, I think this haze is for now my best disguise
No need to think about why
What'cha say, starry-eyed
How you love to smile
And watch the clouds reside
Just tryin' to give it some time

Feeling like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say

I can say that loving you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way
I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table

"I think I'm losing my mind

Trying to stay inside the lines

It's like I'm running in place

How you keep staying the same?

Baby, I, I guess I'm something different

And I'm okay with that

I can't fake no more smiles

That shit gon' drive me mad

I'm focused on the future

Don't care 'bout nothin' else

I'm better by myself

I'm better by myself

I don't need no one else

I'm better by myself

Myself

Don't wanna answer questions

Just want your company

It's all good on the surface

Show me what's underneath

I'm not concerned with drama

I left that shit in school

I'm more concerned with commas

Than keeping up with you

Keep that away from me

I put the Heisman up to bad energy

No empathy, especially when the kid off Hennessy

Fake friends to me make my mood go south like Tennessee

Make the fool come out like, ""Who is he?""

I mean, I'm trying to tell y'all

I'm better by myself

I'm better by myself

I don't need no one else

I'm better by myself

Myself

I don't know who to trust

These days everyone's shady

Fool me once, I'm on my own

There is no second time, baby

That's the shit I don't like

Please no yes, no maybes

"Why I love to give you flowers on a Wednesday, 12 dozen roses at your door.

Or even light some candles when you come over for dinner, I wouldn’t mind to light a billion more.

Or how I like to wake up and see you with no make up, I’d still give you a ring the way you are. 

Or stay up on the phone late at night when you’re alone, looking out the window gazing up at stars.

Chorus: 
So if you’re wondering why I do the things that I do, honestly I don’t know what to say.

All these questions and answers, I just like to have her, every moment every single day.

Verse Two:
Why I love to hold you even in the public, you could call it lovely PDA.

I don’t care what city, you could pick out of the 50 states like California in the bay.

Or how I like to take you to church on every Sunday, holding hands together as we pray.

I dont care if people hate, I dont care what people say, cause my love for you will always be the same.

So if you’re wondering why I do the things that I do, honestly I don’t know what to say.

All these questions and answers, I just like to have her, every moment every single day.

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear.

But I know
(It's gonna take the real work)
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my  tears 
And finally you put me first

Baby it's you.
You're the one I love.
You're the one I need.
You're the only one I see.
Come on baby it's you.

You're the one that gives your all.
You're the one I can always call.

"Lately I`ve had the strangest feeling

With no very reason here to find

Yet the thought of losing you`s been hanging

around my mind

Far more frequently you`re wearing perfume

With you say `No special place to go`

But when I ask, will you be coming back soon

You don`t know, never know

Well, I`m a man of many wishes

Hope my premonition misses

But what I really feel

My eyes won`t let me hide

`Cause they always start to cry

`Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I`ve been staring in the mirror

Very slowly picking me apart

Trying to tell myself I have no reason

with your heart

Just the other night while you were sleeping

I vaguely heard you whisper someone`s name

But, when I asked you other the thoughts you`re keeping

You just said `Nothing`s changed`

Well,I`m a man of many wishes

I hope my premonition misses

what I really feel

My eyes won`t let me hide

`Cause they always start to cry

`Cause this time could mean good bye

Good bye oh~~

Well,I`m a man of many wishes

I hope my premonition misses

My eyes won`t let me hide

최근에 난 이상한 감정을 갖게 되었어요

특별히 명백한 이유는 없지만

당신을 잃을 것 같다는 생각을 떨칠 수 없어요.

내 마음 주위로

요즘 당신은 향수를 자주 사용하는군요

‘어디갈 특별한 이유는 없어' 라고 말하면서

""곧 돌아올 거죠?"" 라고 내가 물으면

당신은 말합니다. 모른다, 절대 모른다고.

난 많은 소원을 가진 남자랍니다

나의 예감이 틀리기를 바라지만

내가 정말 느끼는 것을

나의 눈은 숨기지 못하죠

왜냐면 항상 눈물이 나오니깐

왜냐면 이번에는 아마 당신과 이별을 해야 하니까요

(오 나에게 이야기해 주세요)

최근에 난 거울 속을 들여다 보기 시작했죠

매우 천천히 나를 조각조각 내면서

나 자신에게 무슨 이유가 있다고 말하면서

당신의 마음을 잡지 못한 것은

그대여, 당신이 잠자고 있었던 지난 날 밤에

당신이 희미하게 누군가의 이름을 부르는 것을 들었어요

그러나 내가 당신에게 어떤 생각을 하고 있는 가를 물었을 때

당신은 무심코 말했어요 ‘변한 건 없어!'

난 많은 소원을 가진 남자랍니다

나의 예감이 틀리기를 바라지만

내가 정말 느끼는 것을

chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune 
with the song life was humming?
If pain's living on 
when your body's long gone
And your phantom regret hasn't 
let it go yet
You may not have died in the way 
that you must
All specters are haunted by their 
own lack of trust
When you're all out of time, 
there's nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering
No nations, no race
And Heaven is closer than those 
tears on your face
When the purple rain falls
We are all bathed in it's grace
Heaven's for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here 
when you're not all there yet
But you could be there 
by the end of this song
Where The Weeknd's 
so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on
And if your broken heart's heavy 
when you step on the scale
You'll be lighter than air 
when they pull back the vail
Consider the flowers, 
they don't try to look right
They just open their 
petals and turn to the light
Are you listening real close?
Heaven's not that, it's this
It's the depth of this moment
We don't reach for bliss
God knows life is chaos
But He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind
Train your soul to align
And dance 'til you find that divine boogaloo
In other words
You gotta be Heaven, to see Heaven
May peace be with you",Bazzi,Myself

"Hello, it's me
안녕, 저에요.

I was wondering if after all these years
전 궁금했어요 이 모든 시간이 지나고 나도

You'd like to meet, to go over everything
절 만나서 우리의 모든걸 돌이켜 보고 싶어할지 말이에요

They say that time's supposed to heal ya
시간이 모든걸 치유해 준다고들 하지만

But I ain't done much healing
저는 그러지 못하네요.



Hello, can you hear me?
여보세요, 듣고 있어요?

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
전 우리가 예전에 꿈꾸었던 캘리포니아에 있어요,

When we were younger and free
우리가 더 젊고 자유로웠던 예전에...

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
전 잊었어요 세상이 우리 발밑에 있다고 느끼던 기분이 어땠는지를...

There's such a difference between us and a million miles
우리 사이에는 백만마일 만큼이나 거리가 있어요

지금껏 제가 벌인 모든 것에 대하여 미안하다고

But when I call you never seem to be home
하지만, 그 때마다 당신은 집에 없었어요



Hello from the outside
전화기 너머로 들려오는 Hello

At least I can say that I've tried
적어도 제가 애썼다고 말할 수 있어요.

To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
당신께 상처 줘서 미안하다고 말하기 위해 애썼다고...

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
하지만, 상관 없어요. 더이상 당신은 상처 받지 않을 테니까.



Hello, how are you?
안녕, 잘 지내시죠?

It's so typical of me to talk about myself
늘 이런식으로 내 얘기를 하네요

I'm sorry, I hope that you're well
미안, 당신이 잘 지내시길 바래요



Did you ever make it out of that town
그 마을을 떠난 것이

Where nothing ever happened?
아무일도 일어나지 않아서 인가요?

Moments that we share together losing their meaning
Tell me what the matter is
Feeling like you're fighting me for no fucking reason
Baby take a break from it
Space from all the petty shit should give you healing

Well the rain keeps pouring down
Trouble keeps on coming 'round

I'mma tell you I'm over it)
If you're hiding what you feel
Underneath a bitter pill
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)

Baby I'll take it slowly
The truths of your heart unfolding
I want you to rest in knowing
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)

Now that I'm here without you
Hope that you're better

Will you remember the way that I was
Will you remember me
Will you remember the way that you felt when you're next to me


Will you remember
Do you remember me

We made plans like we would always be
We said by now that we'd have everything and more
I never thought that's we'd be dreaming on our own

" Do you recall, not long ago
 We would walk on the sidewalk
 Innocent, remember?
 All we did was care for each other

 But the night was warm
 We were bold and young
 All around the wind blows
 We would only hold on to let go

 [Chorus x2]
 Blow a kiss, fire a gun
 We need someone to lean on
 Blow a kiss, fire a gun
 All we need is somebody to lean on

 (Eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh) [x4]

 What will we do when we get old?
 Will we walk down the same road?
 Will you be there by my side?
 Standing strong as the waves roll over

 When the nights are long
 Longing for you to come home
 All around the wind blows
 We would only hold on to let go

 [Chorus x2]
 Blow a kiss, fire a gun
 We need someone to lean on
 Blow a kiss, fire a gun
 All we need is somebody to lean on

 (Eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh) [x2]

"You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us
Another start
You fade away

Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
alive

Where are you now

Where are you now
Was it all in my fantasy
Where are you now
Were you only imaginary

Where are you now

Under the sea

Where are you now
Another dream
The monster’s running wild inside of me
I’m faded

I’m faded
So lost, I’m faded
I’m faded
So lost, I’m faded

These shallow waters, never met
What I needed
I’m letting go
A deeper dive

Eternal silence of the sea
I’m breathing
Alive

Where are you now
Where are you now
Under the bright, but faded lights
You set my heart on fire

Where are you now
Where are you now

Where are you now

Where are you now

"I'm sorry but
Don't wanna talk, I need a moment before I go
It's nothing personal
I draw the blinds
They don't need to see my cry
'Cause even if they understand
They don't understand

So then when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery
Making my bitch; can't be everyone's favorite girl

So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way

The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe

Lo siento mucho (Farru), pero me voy (Eh)

"I woke up pissed off today
And lately, everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down
your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming,
but they only
hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be
there for me too

But you gotta be
there for me too

Last year took a toll on me
But I made it
with you next to me
Around the world
and back again
I hope you're waiting
at the end

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down
your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming,
but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road
that goes both ways
When your tears roll down
your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be
there for me too

But you gotta be
there for me too

But I'm holding on
to something
Wake up if you feel nothing
I'm running, running,
just to keep my hands on you
There was a time
that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you
I'm running, running,
just to keep my hands on you
Running, running,
just to keep my hands on you

just to keep my hands on you

"Lily was a little girl 
Afraid of the big , wide world
She grew up within her castle walls

Now and then she tried to run
And then oh the  night with the setting sun
She went in the woods away 
So afraid , all alone

They warned her , Don't go there
There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
Then something came creeping it told her

Don't you worry just follow everywhere i go 
top over the mountains of valley low 
Give you everything you ' ve been dreaming of 

Just let me in , ooh 
Everything you wanted gotta be the magic 
Story you've been told and you ' ll be safe under my control
Just let me in

Just let me in 

She knew she was  hypnotised
And walking on cold thin ice
Then it broke , and she awoke again

Then she ran faster than 
Start screming, is there someone out there ? 
Please help me , come get me 
Behind her , she can hear it say 

Follow everywhere i go 
Top over the mountains of valley low 
Give you everything you ' ve been dreaming of 
Just let me in , ooh 

Everything you wanted gotta be the magic 
story you ' ve been told 
And you ' ll be safe under my control

"I met you in a bar in San Francisco
Said you used to have a car before the repo
Smoking Lucky cigarettes, I think the smoke went to my head
And now that summer night plays on repeat

We climbed the Golden Gate bridge just to watch the stars collide
And played that Stevie Wonder song a couple thousand times
I'm kinda scared to say it was the best night of my life
But I know I won't forget San Francisco
No, I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget that night in San Francisco

When you took that Greyhound bus
Thought it was the end of us

Every part of me that I left in your room
Now I really don't care what you do, or who you do it with
I really don't care, I think I just quit

I was sad now I'm better

But whatever, I'm good (I'm good)

I'm good, I'm good
You fooled me once and you fooled me twice, don't try me again
You're comin' around, tryna wear me down but I won't be your friend
And I dont wanna say it out loud but I still miss you now and then
I'll cover my tracks and I'll never go back cause you're a dead-end

"Hello, hello
Can you hear me, as I scream your name
Hello, hello
Do you meet me, before I fade away

Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie

(We live, we love, we lie)

Hello, hello
Nice to meet your, voice inside my head
Hello, hello
I believe you
How can I forget
 
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side

"[Intro: Patrick Stump]

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]

She looks good in the morning

And she don't even know it

I don't want you to go yet

Can we stay in the moment?

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes

When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like

You look good in the morning

And you don't even know it

I knew that

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

[Verse 2: Macklemore]

Sundress with you on my arm

Take the coupe out the garage

Pull the roof back just me, you and the stars

Toast to the Gods

She's the one, a masterpiece

She a drug got a fast release

Got me sprung wrapped in sheets

Wake up, fuck, and then we going back to sleep

[Verse 3: Macklemore]

Me and you on an island

With the ocean color stuck in your iris

We're comfortable in silence

But I prefer when we wilding

Sundress, nothing underneath as we undress

You could look in my eyes see I'm some mess

Couple of broken people

Trying to complete each other

Under one breath

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes

When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like

You look good in the morning

And you don't even know it

I knew that

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

And when you’re gone I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

"You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now
I'm sorry, yeah

"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the ""Get Well Soon"" cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But, mom, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces. It's tearing me up but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""
Hallelujah, you're home
I fluffed the pillows
made the beds
stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive
then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""
Hallelujah, you're home
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
he said, ""Hallelujah, you're home""",Daft Punk,One More Time

I got what you needed
it's all in the way that you say my name

Might get burned
if you get too closer To the sun
I want yah
We can burn together
Fading into one another
ooooh well don't you know

You're still heaven to me
Baby we could run free
if you do it just the way I like
maybe I could waste my time on you
Never mind all our worries
if you do it just the way I like
maybe I could waste my time on you",Galantis,Satisfied (Feat. MAX)

"Stranger things, we're like, we're like a stranger things, very far
We're stranger things, dream of places at
'Cause that's just who we are
We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out?
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember
We left the light that's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love
Like I'm picturing now
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountain to the foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I see a technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it
We turned our back on ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love
Show me the sky falling down
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountain to the ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get there

"Hello, sweet grief
I know you will be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea

Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got
If I had a diamond heart
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
Cause every station is playing our song
Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made of
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

I'd give you all my love

it was easy must have had it pretty good

I want you boy just to please me
Don't tell me that you could

It's beautiful in a way with love
But what's a girl to do
when you can't seem to choose?
You're beautiful but your mind's restrained
When your mind is split two ways is
when the comedown plays

Don't touch me
Boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you
I'm waiting
And I'm patient
I'm deluded
You have someone that loves you

Touch me touch me

You want me close so I hear you
I thought I made it clear
don't whisper in my ear
My heart it keeps getting weaker
I know you want me near
but your love is what I fear
It's beautiful the way you move
But what's a boy to do
when he can't seem to choose?
Yeah I'm beautiful
but I must explain
My mind's not in a good place

And i'll guide you

To dodge a smoking gun

"I was playing on the beach with my best friends band
And it was such a bummer, yeah
The way that you left before I got a chance
To tell you that you're wavy like the water when the tide is rolling in
Those seashells in your hair l'll hear the ocean when we kiss
I think I'm crazy bout the way that you tug on your sweater
When it don't fit just right but I think that that's better
I miss the sunshine
Not the heat on the beach
But the way that your eyes, shined on me
I miss the starlight
It wasn't for long
And I'd hoped you'd be here
But you're gone now
Because it's hopeless
I'm at work and I can't focus
And you don't even know this
And you don't even know me
And you didn't even notice
When I held your hand and pulled you on the stage
You put me in hypnosis
You got me in hypnosis baby
I loved the last song
Cause I know it's your favorite
It won't last long
Cause you're always changing
Take some time off
And let's get back to the basics
And know this
Our love will grow post hypnosis
Oh and I'm still dazed
From watching you too closely
I can't think straight
Cause every single morning
I wake up next to nothing and got nowhere to be
Just a couple small chores and a few groceries
And I dance all day picture you in my mind
I'd like to go back in time
And leave my number behind
I miss the sunshine
Not the heat on the beach
But the way that your eyes, shined on me
I miss the starlight

Mirrors they never lie
Don't see myself inside
Why can't I get it right?
I don't know
You're always watching me fall
Shadows they like my wall
Why do I feel so small?
I don't know

So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know

I've lost, I've lost
I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
Ooh

Tired of being afraid
But lately, I've lost my faith
What is love without pain, it ain't home
You're watching me but I'm below
When I get caught I hope
This is kinda like how they will
Take me home

So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know

I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again

[Macklemore:]
 Cigarettes in the ashtray
 Reminiscing on those past days
 I thought you'd end up with my last name
 But that changed
 And I traveled around the world
 Think where you living at now?
 I heard you moved to Austin
 Got an apartment and settled down
 And every once in a while
 I start texting
 Write a paragraph
 But then I delete the message
 Think 'bout you like a past time
 I could cry you a river
 Get you baptised or
 I wasn't ready to act right
 Used to always think I'd get you back, right
 They say that things fall apart
 We were gonna move to Brooklyn
 You were gonna study Art
 Love is just a tool
 To remind us who we are
 And that we are not alone
 And we're walking in the dark

[Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen:]
 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
 We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start.
hey tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
My life will pass me by if I don't
open up my eyes
Well its fine by me.
so wake me up when its all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost.

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance
to travel the world
I don't have any plans.
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize
so wake me up when its all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost.

What I needed

A deeper dive

Eternal silence of the sea

Under the bright, but faded lights
You set my heart on fire

In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable

Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday

Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love

See my confidence is shaking
And my heart is feeling vacant

You're worth saving darling

why you're shooting in the dark

But love pray for me

So I don't know how to love
Pray for me
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love

Cause my memory's on trial
For the way I used to be
My head is running miles
Round in circles and I try
To find the little light in me

I can fix the broken in your heart
You're worth saving darling

"Hey, once upon a younger year
 When all our shadows disappeared
 The animals inside came out to play
 Hey, when face to face with all our fears
 Learned our lessons through the tears
 Made memories we knew would never fade

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let it slip away
 He took me in his arms, I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.
 My father told me when I was just a child
 These are the nights that never die
 My father told me



 When thunder clouds start pouring down
 Light a fire they cant put out
 Carve your name into those shinning stars
 He said, Go venture far beyond these shores.
 Dont forsake this life of yours.
 Ill guide you home no matter where you are.

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let this slip away.
 When I was just a kid I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 So live a life you will remember.

Run away (run away), run away from you

You got the face of an angel
But the heart of a monster
Body of a god, yeah, hey
But your heart ain't true
I put my life on the line
'Cause I was waiting for you
You told me to show I was true
But you broke my heart into two, ah
I should've read, I should've read from the signs
Everything we had was a lie
Now I'm out here believing love is a crime
But I got a plan
I got to run away (run away), run away from you
Run away (run away), run away from you

"We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything

It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Sh
Tape my eyes open to force reality
Why can't you just let me eat my weight in glee?
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
And some days I can't tell if my body belongs to me
I love everything
Fire spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
sh
I wanna taste your content
Hold your breath and feel the tension
Devils hide behind redemption
Honesty is a one way gate to hell
I wanna taste consumption
Breathe faster to waste oxygen
Hear the children sing aloud
It's music till the wick burns out
Hush
Just wanna be care free lately, yeah
Just kicking up daisies
Got one too many quarters in my pockets
Count 'em like the four leaf clovers in my locket
Untied laces, yeah
Just tripping on daydreams
Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat
Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep","Calvin Harris, Dua Lipa",One Kiss
"It's a new day, new day, and it's evident
You must have been heaven-sent
Sometimes we should be hesitant, but I'm not at all
Just feelin more confident
Just using my common sense
Just trust in it, I'm lovin it

I can't refuse an offer so benevolent
Can't assume he's gon' use me 
And after he'll never call again
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
This is your day, this is your day

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
Cus I've become brave
As the light of day straight into a cave
To show me the way, that I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave

I am brave, I am brave

I heard him say this thing moving too fast for him
It's a feelin I was straddeling
Foolishly adamant, but It's all in his eyes
Really wish he would let me in
Cus the same way I'm scared of him
I'm scared of being hurt again

It's time to let go, let go of your heart
It's time for a brand new start
Never know, we might never part
Baby don't be afraid, don't be afraid
This is your day, this is your day

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
Cus I've become brave
As the light of day straight into a cave
To show me the way, that I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave

I wouldn't take back anything that I've gone through (no)
I pray for strength for anything that I'm gonna do
Whether joy, or it's pain, I'm still okay (I, I'm still okay)
I'm a be alright cause I'm not afraid
No, I am brave (brave)

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore

"We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought Wow, if I could
take this in a shot right now
I don't think that
we could work this out

Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought
How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted for someone else

If we go down then
we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then
we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud standing there
with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself
on the internet

Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air
of this small town
On our own cuttin' class
for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past
we were livin' in

If we go down then
we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever

"Wake up in the morning 
feeling like P Diddy (Hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, 
I'm gonna hit this city (Lets go)
Before I leave, brush my 
teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave 
for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Trying on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pulling up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no

Ain't got a care in world, 
but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, 
but I'm already here
And now, the dudes are lining up 
cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick em to the curb unless 
they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

Now, now, we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock

You break me down

Yeah, you got me

With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah, you got me

You break me down

"[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Verse 3: Kelsea Ballerini & Andrew Taggart]
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

[Pre-Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Andrew Taggart]
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

It'll come back when you let it go
And baby, all this distance
It's only made my feelings grow

And I still got your face on the lock on my phone

Know with all of your heart
You can't shake me
When I am with you
There's no place I'd rather be.

No no no no no
No place I'd rather be

So nothing's incomplete

It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity.

Not focused on facts it's a cap
Moving too, fast let's recap
Say we kick back
We relapse
Moving too fast, let's recap
Not focused on facts it's a cap
Moving too, fast let's recap


It's your life, it's your world
I don't mean to interfere
It's your life, it's amazing
But I want you to fit in mine, mine


I need a recap
Came through for the night cap
In the S class, and you can't see through the glass
I keep the tint on
To protect the mood
Let me play a song
I need to see you move
You a bad lil thang with a attitude
But this patek on my wrist might change yourview
Reservation, she like Nobu
I can shut the building down
And make a table for two
The way I put it on can't be taboo
I know it's been so long I been waiting on you
Been through this before
Feelings can't ignore
I know what's in store
I need more décor
I thought love and war was impossible
Ain't nothin' stopping you
Ain't nothin' stopping you


Do you see, darling?
Are you listening?
I'm still trying
Maybe I could make you change your ways


Say we kick back
We relapse
Moving too fast, let's recap
Not focused on facts it's a cap
Moving too, fast let's recap
Say we kick back
We relapse
Moving too fast, let's recap
Not focused on facts it's a cap

"I know we've been close since we were kids
And you used to swing my way, knock my door, come out to play
You'd tell me everything I'm always listening
To the stories that we made while we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's gеtting louder and the drinks are gеtting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I'm singing hallelujah
I think my shirt would suit ya
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

It happens every time that we go out
Wish that I could walk you home, instead I text you on your phone
Some drunken message that I know that I'll regret
It was simple in the days, when we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's getting louder and the drinks are getting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober

"Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

And if you feel you're sinking,

Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us 
into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, 
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us 
into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go 
(I won't let go, no no, no no no no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope someone come 
and take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know you won't let go

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
제가 갑자기 불청객으로 나타나긴 싫지만
※out of the blue : 갑자기, 별안간

But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
전 멀리할 수도 없었고 그러려고 (저 자신과) 싸울 수도 없었어요

I had hoped you'd see my face
전 바랐었죠 당신이 제 얼굴을 보고

And that you'd be reminded that for me
제게 상기시켜주었으면 했어요..

It isn't over
아직 끝이 아니란 걸요...



Never mind, I'll find someone like you
괜찮아요, 당신 같은 누군가를 찾으면 돼요.

I wish nothing but the best of you too
당신이 행복하기만 바랄게요

Don't forget me, I beg
절 잊지 마세요, 제발요.

I remember you said
당신이 말했던 걸 기억해요

Sometimes it lasts in love
그 말이 사랑으로 남기도 하지만

But sometimes it hurts instead
이따금 상처가 되기도 해요

Sometimes it lasts in love
그 말이 사랑으로 남기도 하지만

But sometimes it hurts instead
이따금 상처가 되기도 해요



You know how the time flies
아시잖아요, 시간이 얼마나 빨리 흐르는지

Only yesterday was the time of our lives
우리가 살아온 시간이 어제가 다 인 것 같아요

We were born and raised in a summer haze
우린 여름 안개 속에서 태어나서 자랐어요

Bound by the surprise of our glory days
눈부신 나날들 속의 놀라움에 빠진 채로..

Nothing compares,
어느 것과도 비교할 수는 없어요

No worries or cares
걱정도 염려도 마세요

Regrets and mistakes,
후회와 실수들이란게

They're memories made
추억에서 만들어 진 것(만들어진 추억일) 뿐이에요

Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
누가 알았겠어요 추억이란게 이렇게 달콤하고도 씁쓸할지를요?



Never mind, I'll find someone like you

"This part I do alone
I'll take my lead
I'll take my lead on this road
And I need something to hold
Make me believe in make beliefs
'Cause after the light is it dark
Is it dark all alone
All alone
You are now listening to 103.5 Dawn FFM
You've been in the dark for way too long
It's time to walk into the light
And accept your fate with open arms

"It's five a.m. my time again
I've soaking up the moon, can't sleep
It's five a.m. my time again
I'm calling and you know it's me
I'm pushing myself further
I'm just trying to feel 
my heartbeat beat (Beat)
I wrap my hands around your neck
You love it when I always squeeze
It's five a.m. and I'm high again
And you can see that I'm in pain
I've fallen into emptiness
I want you 'cause we're both insane
I'm staring into the abyss
I'm looking at myself again
I'm dozing off to R.E.M
I'm trying not to lose my faith
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me
I know you won't let me OD
And if I finally die in peace
Just wrap my body in thеse sheets
And pour out the gasoline
It don't mеan much to me
It's five a.m., I'm nihilist
I know there's nothing after this
Obsessing over aftermaths
Apocalypse and hopelessness
The only thing I understand
Is zero sum of tenderness (Tenderness)
Oh baby, please just hold me close
Make me believe there's more to live
Around, around, around, around we go
In this game called life, we are not free
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me 
(Don't let me go)
I know you won't let me OD

And if I finally die in peace (Oh yeah)
Just wrap my body in these sheets
And pour out the gasoline
It don't mean much to me",The Chainsmokers,Paris
"Momentary nights in your paradise
I need your moments every night
'Cause you make a wrong feel like a right
Open blinded eyes
I don't know what the end is like
But I wanna be there with you

Tell me it's love you're not just craving my touch
Got some things to clean up, we'll be fine
While you face all your fears I promise I'll be right here
When you need me just call anytime
And we can float in the midnight river (Hmm)
We can fly through the moonlit sky (Hmm)
And wе can float in the midnight river
We can fly through thе moonlit sky
For the rest of our lives

Appreciating every magical encounter
That go with insecurities, they don't matter
All of the chatter, I'm in the mix, the batter
Had to play a batter, 'bout to swing and shatter
Any expectation, brand new revelation
Better conversation, with no limitation
Got no time to play it like a station, ayy
You know I'm on the way and I could almost taste the day
Taste the you, give a nigga déjà vu
Welcome back I feel like Ma$e did too, true
Hallelujah to the sky, feel like I died and went to Heaven
It's love and I just hope you get the message

Tell me it's love you're not just craving my touch
Got some things to clean up, we'll be fine
While you face all your fears I promise I'll be right here
When you need me just call anytime
And we can float in the midnight river
We can fly through the moonlit sky (Hmm)
And we can float in the midnight river
We can fly through the moonlit sky
For the rest of our lives

"I was born in a city
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life is always with me
The ice inside my veins will never bleed
Every time you try to fix me
I know you'll never find that missing piece
When you cry and say you miss me
I lie and tell you that I'll never leave
But
I sacrifice
Your love for more of the night
I try to put up a fight
Can't tie me down
I don't want to sacrifice
For your love
I try
I don't want to sacrifice
But I love my time
I hold you through the toughest parts

"The last few months, 
I've been working on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones 
who loved me, baby
I look back now and realize
I remember when I held you
You begged me 
with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Gimme one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like 
I should've loved you all the time
I remember when I held you 
(Held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning 
eyes to stay (Never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
Oh, singing, out of time
Said I had you to myself
But I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
Out of time
Out of time
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, 
you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely 
engulfed in the blissful 
embrace of that little light 
you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, 
forgiven and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever

"There's a fire starting in my heart
제 맘속에 분노의 불꽃이 타오르기 시작했어요

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
활활 타오르면서, 절 어둠 속으로부터 나오게 했어요

Finally, I can see you crystal clear
이제서야 당신이란 인간이 분명히 보이네요

Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your sheet bare
계속 절 팔고 다녀봐요, 저도 당신을 다 까발릴테니까

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
어떻게 당신 모든 걸 가지고 떠나는 지 두고 봐요

Don't underestimate the things that I will do
제가 어떻게 할 지 우습게 생각하지 않는게 (좋을거에요)



There's a fire starting in my heart
제 맘속에 분노의 불꽃이 타오르기 시작했어요

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
활활 타오르면서, 절 어둠 속으로부터 나오게 했어요

The scars of your love remind me of us
사랑의 상처들이 우리를 돌아보게 만들어요

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
그 상처들이 우리가 모든걸 가졌었다고 생각나게 하네요

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
사랑의 상처 들이 절 숨막히게 해요

I can't help feeling
제가 그렇게 느낄 수 밖에 없어요



We could have had it all
우린 전부 가질 수도 있었어요

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
(당신은 절 만나지 않았었으면 생각 할테지만요)

Rolling in the deep
깊이 빠져들면서

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
(눈물이 날거에요, 깊이 빠져들면서)



You had my heart inside of your hand
당신은 제 심장을 손에 쥐고

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
(당신은 절 만나지 않았었으면 생각 할테지만)

And you played it, to the beat
제 마음을 조종했죠, 심장박동에 맞춰서...

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
(눈물이 날거에요, 깊이 빠져들면서)



Baby, I have no story to be told
제가 당신께 들려 줄 얘기는 없지만

But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
당신에 관한 얘기를 하나 들었고, 난 당신을 화나게 할 작정이에요

Think of me in the depths of your despair
깊은 절망에 빠져 저를 생각해보세요

Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
저 처럼 그 절망 속에서 살아봐요, 당연히 같이 할 생각은 없어요

제 마음을 조종했죠, 심장박동에 맞춰서...

Throw your soul through every open door
문이 열려 있다면 당신의 영혼을 버리세요

Count your blessings to find what you look for
당신께 주어진 축복을 헤아려봐요, 바라는 무언가를 얻는 축복을...

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
제 슬픔을 소중한 금으로 돌려놓으세요

You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

"I look at the time through anxious eyes
Leave it alone they say a watched clock never boils
But I still watch away anyway 
I hold my breath a little longer 
How can I say or do a thing 
When I got so many things
Racing through my head 

Before 4:30 
Before 4:30
Can't do a thing
With her all my brain 

Before 4:30
Before 4:30 
How should i try
To make her mine 

Do I tell her she looks lovely
like a classic movie cliche 
Do I, Do I..
Take you somewhere rich and fancy 
Or a casual cafe darling I do
Darling I
Can't wait to see you today 

I see you lookin at the time
all anxiously
look again and check that yes still 
half past 3 
60 minutes till you meet the one you talkin all about for weeks 

so what you doin
clean your hair
brush your teeth
and don't be nervous when you 
two finally meet
be a gentleman 

you'll be okay
and my god stop lookin at the clock I'll tell you when you gotta leave 

you lookin good
you lookin fresh
shoulder straight head up look ahead
spray this 
chew that 
take this 
and don't forget
Just be yourself when the clock 
says 4 and 30 

go and tell her she looks lovely!!


like a classic movie cliche 

do I take her somewhere rich and fancy?
or a casual cafe darling I do, darling I
can't wait to see you today
  
So I told her she looks lovely
like a classic movie cliche 

and I took her to the park
and talked while counting all of the stars 

and when we said goodnight

"Oh can I explain myself to you
Questions been lurking through my mind
Is it the lover for the time
I've given my heart my joy my soul to you
If it is real I sure can't see
Gotta start lookin' out for me
And in my, my heart won't take no more
I know you say that I don't care
Sometimes my way of life ain't fair
I feel it's sad for me you take the chance
So you are givin' me no choice
I think I must exercise my voice and say
This feeling there's no drug that can compare
You're so cold I can't see your breath I swear
And they told me not to fall in love
Wondering where it all went wrong
You were my poison all along
Late at night I lay awake in tears and pain (Tears and pain)
Askin' my heart for What went wrong (Hey)
Askin' myself What's goin' on
Oh come on we seem to see things eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Somehow I didn't feel the danger (Hey)
And now I'm sleeping with a stranger
To see all these years we flushed them down the drain (Down the drain)
Was that a love we can't promise
Now it's too late for both of us
No regrets for what we lost and what we shared
Maybe tomorrow we'll love again
But until then we'll stay as friends
This feeling there's no drug that can compare
You're so cold I can't see your breath I swear
They told me not to fall in love

"Looking back now, 
I didn't know what it was supposed to be
And it's like raising kids, man
If you weren't raised, 
they don't know how to raise, you know?
I just did the best that 
I could with them because 
they know fuckin' well I love them
But I didn't do the best 
I could — I didn't know what the fuck 
I was doing — I didn't
I will never forget watching 
my mother get 
put in a straightjacket and taken 
out of my home 
when I was only seven years old
She was diagnosed with Dementia 
praecox and put in a mental institution 
leaving my daddy alone 
with me and my little brothеr Lloyd
I later had an evil stepmothеr 
who further cemented the idea 
that I didn't need a mother
Growing up without one had long 
lasting impressions I didn't fully 
understand until much later in life
It bled into my relationships 
with family and those 
I had became romantically involved with
Whenever I got too close to a woman, 
I would cut her off
Part of that was vindictive and partially 
based on fear, 
but it was also totally subconsious

I'd be lying if I said that

I can't fake no more smiles

That shit gon' drive me mad

I'm focused on the future

Don't care 'bout nothin' else

I'm better by myself

I'm better by myself

I don't need no one else

I'm better by myself

Myself

Don't wanna answer questions

Just want your company

It's all good on the surface

Show me what's underneath

I'm not concerned with drama

I left that shit in school

I'm more concerned with commas

Than keeping up with you

Keep that away from me

I put the Heisman up to bad energy

No empathy, especially when the kid off Hennessy

Fake friends to me make my mood go south like Tennessee

Make the fool come out like, ""Who is he?""

I mean, I'm trying to tell y'all

I'm better by myself

I'm better by myself

I don't need no one else

I'm better by myself

Or how I like to wake up and see you with no make up, I’d still give you a ring the way you are. 

Or stay up on the phone late at night when you’re alone, looking out the window gazing up at stars.

Chorus: 
So if you’re wondering why I do the things that I do, honestly I don’t know what to say.

All these questions and answers, I just like to have her, every moment every single day.

Why I love to hold you even in the public, you could call it lovely PDA.

I don’t care what city, you could pick out of the 50 states like California in the bay.

Or how I like to take you to church on every Sunday, holding hands together as we pray.

I dont care if people hate, I dont care what people say, cause my love for you will always be the same.

"Lately I`ve had the strangest feeling

With no very reason here to find

Yet the thought of losing you`s been hanging

around my mind

Far more frequently you`re wearing perfume

With you say `No special place to go`

But when I ask, will you be coming back soon

You don`t know, never know

Well, I`m a man of many wishes

Hope my premonition misses

But what I really feel

My eyes won`t let me hide

`Cause they always start to cry

`Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I`ve been staring in the mirror

Very slowly picking me apart

Trying to tell myself I have no reason

with your heart

Just the other night while you were sleeping

I vaguely heard you whisper someone`s name

But, when I asked you other the thoughts you`re keeping

You just said `Nothing`s changed`

Well,I`m a man of many wishes

I hope my premonition misses

what I really feel

My eyes won`t let me hide

`Cause they always start to cry

`Cause this time could mean good bye

Good bye oh~~

Well,I`m a man of many wishes

I hope my premonition misses

최근에 난 이상한 감정을 갖게 되었어요

특별히 명백한 이유는 없지만

당신을 잃을 것 같다는 생각을 떨칠 수 없어요.

내 마음 주위로

요즘 당신은 향수를 자주 사용하는군요

‘어디갈 특별한 이유는 없어' 라고 말하면서

""곧 돌아올 거죠?"" 라고 내가 물으면

당신은 말합니다. 모른다, 절대 모른다고.

난 많은 소원을 가진 남자랍니다

나의 예감이 틀리기를 바라지만

내가 정말 느끼는 것을

나의 눈은 숨기지 못하죠

왜냐면 항상 눈물이 나오니깐

왜냐면 이번에는 아마 당신과 이별을 해야 하니까요

(오 나에게 이야기해 주세요)

최근에 난 거울 속을 들여다 보기 시작했죠

매우 천천히 나를 조각조각 내면서

나 자신에게 무슨 이유가 있다고 말하면서

당신의 마음을 잡지 못한 것은

그대여, 당신이 잠자고 있었던 지난 날 밤에

당신이 희미하게 누군가의 이름을 부르는 것을 들었어요

그러나 내가 당신에게 어떤 생각을 하고 있는 가를 물었을 때

당신은 무심코 말했어요 ‘변한 건 없어!'

난 많은 소원을 가진 남자랍니다

나의 예감이 틀리기를 바라지만

내가 정말 느끼는 것을

I can't get off her love
I can't get off her drug
I get to panicking
When she go vanishing
Ain't no sign in the shade room
She say, ""Broke bitches they be late soon""
Know I like it when you make rules
Tell me more I can pay you

Do what I'm liking
This feeling so righteous
How did you know I wouldn't fight this
Baby go spend it all
Let's catch a flight then
Eat, get the itis
Hoping some day I don't wake up
I'll pay up

Feels like I'm buying more time
So keep grooving
And don't stop
What you're doing
I'm buying more time
'Cause I need an overdose of that

And tell me you're mine (ooh ooh)
Mine (ooh ooh)
You're mine (ooh ooh)
You're mine
And tell me you're mine (ooh ooh)
Mine (ooh ooh)
You're mine (ooh ooh)
You're mine
Tell me you're mine

Fancy car, ride on my heart
Fancy car, shy? You ain't shy, no
Heart, more than you know
Ours, diamond and gold
The vice, all that we know
The life, diamond and gold
The vice, all that we know
The lights, all that we know
The eyes, all that she knows
The life, all that she'll know",John Legend,All Of Me
"Girl you're a river
Of healing
I was certain that I wouldn't last
And you are the answer
To questions
That I didn't know my soul was asking

My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life

'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
I have been broken
And beaten
Yeah the world knows how to break you down
But when pain blurs my vision
I won't worry
Because you always turn it back around 

My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life

'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my Center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
 'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my Center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine 
Too good to be mine 
Got me feeling like it's too good to be 
Too good to be mine",Bren Joy,Insecure (Feat. Pink Sweat$)
"You're turned in to Dawn FM
The middle of nowhere on your dial
So sit back and unpack
You may be here awhile
Now that all future plans 
have been postponed
And it's time to look back 
on the things you thought you owned
Do you remember them well?
Were you high or just stoned?
And how many grudges 
did you take to your grave?
When you weren't liked or followed, 
how did you behave?
Was it often a dissonant 
chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune 
with the song life was humming?
If pain's living on 
when your body's long gone
And your phantom regret hasn't 
let it go yet
You may not have died in the way 
that you must
All specters are haunted by their 
own lack of trust
When you're all out of time, 
there's nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering
No nations, no race
And Heaven is closer than those 
tears on your face
When the purple rain falls
We are all bathed in it's grace
Heaven's for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here 
when you're not all there yet
But you could be there 
by the end of this song
Where The Weeknd's 
so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on
And if your broken heart's heavy 
when you step on the scale
You'll be lighter than air 
when they pull back the vail
Consider the flowers, 
they don't try to look right
They just open their 
petals and turn to the light
Are you listening real close?
Heaven's not that, it's this
It's the depth of this moment
We don't reach for bliss
God knows life is chaos
But He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind
Train your soul to align
And dance 'til you find that divine boogaloo
In other words
You gotta be Heaven, to see Heaven
May peace be with you",Pink Sweat$,I Feel Good

"Hello, it's me
안녕, 저에요.

I was wondering if after all these years
전 궁금했어요 이 모든 시간이 지나고 나도

You'd like to meet, to go over everything
절 만나서 우리의 모든걸 돌이켜 보고 싶어할지 말이에요

They say that time's supposed to heal ya
시간이 모든걸 치유해 준다고들 하지만

But I ain't done much healing
저는 그러지 못하네요.



Hello, can you hear me?
여보세요, 듣고 있어요?

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
전 우리가 예전에 꿈꾸었던 캘리포니아에 있어요,

When we were younger and free
우리가 더 젊고 자유로웠던 예전에...

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
전 잊었어요 세상이 우리 발밑에 있다고 느끼던 기분이 어땠는지를...

There's such a difference between us and a million miles
우리 사이에는 백만마일 만큼이나 거리가 있어요

I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
지금껏 제가 벌인 모든 것에 대하여 미안하다고

But when I call you never seem to be home
하지만, 그 때마다 당신은 집에 없었어요



Hello from the outside
전화기 너머로 들려오는 Hello

At least I can say that I've tried
적어도 제가 애썼다고 말할 수 있어요.

To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
당신께 상처 줘서 미안하다고 말하기 위해 애썼다고...

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
하지만, 상관 없어요. 더이상 당신은 상처 받지 않을 테니까.



Hello, how are you?
안녕, 잘 지내시죠?

It's so typical of me to talk about myself
늘 이런식으로 내 얘기를 하네요

I'm sorry, I hope that you're well
미안, 당신이 잘 지내시길 바래요



Did you ever make it out of that town
그 마을을 떠난 것이

Where nothing ever happened?
아무일도 일어나지 않아서 인가요?

It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time
우리 둘이 시간을 허비하고 있다는게 비밀도 아니에요

Everyday scrubbing it lovin it
crusin freeways in our PJs c
cause thats the fun of it unless
you wear that pretty black dress o yes
catch me in a suit so i can look as good as you
but i dont owell 
with that smile that you wear so well
and the way that you cry in movies
pass you the ball and pass it back to me
beers with the guys 
aint no thing
its your eyes and the simple things
that make this work like it should
when you rock my shirt
o you look so good 
so take my hand n stay as long as you can w the man

Can you tell me what I did wrong?

Though we're not meant to be
Know we were meant to meet
You were a blessing in disguise
We tried to make amends
But God had different plans
I see my future in your eyes
And it's not by your side
It's for the best baby
We're both going places
We need to grow

We were both just a stepping stone
Giving, getting growth
And now it's time to let each other go
I never thought the best thing I could do for you
Was to be true just to myself

Though we're not meant to be
Know we were meant to meet
You were a blessing in disguise (yeah)
We tried to make amends
But God had different plans
I see my future in your eyes
And it's not by your side
It's for the best baby
We're both going places
We need to grow

Just keep your head held high
No, forever wasn't right
But the future's still so bright
I feel it, I feel it
So keep your head held high
Make that shift inside your mind
Give yourself a little time
To feel it, to feel it

Though we're not meant to be
Know we were meant to meet
You were a blessing in disguise
We tried to make amends
But God had different plans
I see my future in your eyes

We need to grow

"When we're all alone and the night has falled 
And lost in what each other needs 
When the silence echoes our nervous hearts 
And all is just the way we feel 
I can't hide it, shouldn't fight it
Go with instinct  
why deny it
You are all I ever wanted   
So let's run free
And loose ourselves in love
We've never been here before 
So were gonna take our time 
Ooohh We've never been here before 
So were gonna take our time Ooooh
You shy away you was afraid   
To give into something so real 
Allow desire to rule your head 
Get lost in what we feel
You can't hide it shouldn't fight it 
Go with instinct why deny it 
You are all I ever wanted 
So let's run free

"Would it make you feel better, babe
If I told you I've been feeling things you don't believe in?
Thinking that I'm seeing things
Your heart is in the ground and my head's through the ceiling
All the possibilities
Losing my ability to know what you're feeling

I've been wondering what you think about
Baby you don't tell me so I'm only assuming
You don't think I hear you out
But say you're happy long as I'm giving the time that I'm due and
I could never leave you now
But if you feel like walking out, baby then do it

If you're hiding what you feel
Underneath a bitter pill
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)

I've been searching for the point of it
Moments that we share together losing their meaning
Tell me what the matter is
Feeling like you're fighting me for no fucking reason
Baby take a break from it
Space from all the petty shit should give you healing

 Will we walk down the same road?

that goes both ways

I'll be there for you

There's creatures who are hiding in the dark

And walking on cold thin ice

Start screming, is there someone out there ?

Let's just believe their lies
Believe it, I see it
I know that you can feel
No secrets worth keeping
So fool me like I'm dreaming
Take me through the night
Fall in to the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Fall in to the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Take me through the night
Fall in to the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall in to the dark side
Fall in to the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light

"I'm good without my baby, better without him
I was so young, I was so dumb when I gave you my heart
Think you're so mean, think you're so clean in your old classic car
But honestly looks can be deceiving you look good from afar
But when you're up close you're a loser and you lowered the bar
Oooo, finally got back everything I gave to you
Every part of me that I left in your room
Now I really don't care what you do, or who you do it with
I really don't care, I think I just quit
I was bad now I'm better
I was sad now I'm better
Looking back I knew you were no good (no good)
I'm by myself and that's better
For my health you know know you put me through hell
But whatever, I'm good (I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
You fooled me once and you fooled me twice, don't try me again
You're comin' around, tryna wear me down but I won't be your friend
And I dont wanna say it out loud but I still miss you now and then
I'll cover my tracks and I'll never go back cause you're a dead-end
Oooo, finally got back everything I gave to you
Every part of me that I left in your room
Now I really don't care what you do, or who you do it with
I really don't care, I think I just quit
I was bad now I'm better

"Hello, hello
Can you hear me, as I scream your name
Hello, hello
Do you meet me, before I fade away

Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie

(We live, we love, we lie)

Hello, hello
Nice to meet your, voice inside my head
Hello, hello
I believe you
How can I forget

Wanna dance you out of my (gotta dance you out of my) hips, my thighs, my wrongs, my rights

"[Intro: Patrick Stump]

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]

She looks good in the morning

And she don't even know it

I don't want you to go yet

Can we stay in the moment?

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes

When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like

You look good in the morning

And you don't even know it

I knew that

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

[Verse 2: Macklemore]

Sundress with you on my arm

Take the coupe out the garage

Pull the roof back just me, you and the stars

Toast to the Gods

She's the one, a masterpiece

She a drug got a fast release

Got me sprung wrapped in sheets

Wake up, fuck, and then we going back to sleep

[Verse 3: Macklemore]

Me and you on an island

With the ocean color stuck in your iris

We're comfortable in silence

But I prefer when we wilding

Sundress, nothing underneath as we undress

You could look in my eyes see I'm some mess

Couple of broken people

Trying to complete each other

Under one breath

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes

When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like

You look good in the morning

And you don't even know it

I knew that

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the ""Get Well Soon"" cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But, mom, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces. It's tearing me up but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""
Hallelujah, you're home
I fluffed the pillows
made the beds
stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive
then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""
Hallelujah, you're home

You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back

"Fallen in love
I feel like I'm feel like I'm in a daze
Under the sun
Here and there I don't know where which way
I had to take a look inside of me 
Figure out what I really need, baby so 
Went outside and found the inner peace 
I could let it all go 

Baby girl you were the one, who showed me how to love
And baby girl you were the one who taught me
And baby girl you are the one who showed me where to go
And baby girl you are the one that is my heart

Now that you're here I don't have to wait around
Take my hand we could fly above the clouds 
Just me and you yeah baby us two
us two us two us two 

Now that you're here I don't have to wait around
Take my hand we could fly above the clouds 
Just me and you yeah baby us two

There's nobody but you
Fallen in love
There's nobody

There's nobody but you
That I would spend my life with no
I wouldn't know what to do without you

you set me on fire
When I'm by your side
you taking me higher
I follow you down
If we go down
Now you say you wanna get away
You wanna take me all the way

if you get too closer To the sun
I want yah
We can burn together
Fading into one another

You're still heaven to me
Baby we could run free
if you do it just the way I like
maybe I could waste my time on you
Never mind all our worries
if you do it just the way I like
maybe I could waste my time on you

My deepest of secrets
Trust you to keep 'em
Hiding the worlds
You cannot say
I got what you wanted
I got what you needed
it's all in the way that you say my name

Might get burned
if you get too closer To the sun

"Stranger things, we're like, we're like a stranger things, very far
We're stranger things, dream of places at
'Cause that's just who we are
We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out?
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember
We left the light that's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love
Like I'm picturing now
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountain to the foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I see a technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it
We turned our back on ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love

"Hello, sweet grief
I know you will be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea

Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got
If I had a diamond heart
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
Cause every station is playing our song
Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made of
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone

"We cloud people, we live in gray
Why we don't need release in rain?
We cloud people, we never stay
We hold our freedom like a plane
We won't be dry soon
Here come the tides
You move when I do
You'll never be mine
We won't be dry soon
Here come the tides
You move when I do
You'll never be mine
I'm not supposed to feel
I'm not supposed to miss
How am I supposed to heal?
How am I supposed to fit?
A little awkward then
A little oxygen
I let you get away
I held the ocean in
We cloud people, we live in gray
If you love me let me float away
We won't be dry soon (Won't be dry)
Here come the tides
You move when I do (Won't be mine)
You'll never be mine
We won't be dry soon (Won't be dry)

"""These Days""
(feat. Dan Caplen, Jess Glynne & Macklemore)


 [Macklemore:]
 I know you moved onto someone new
 Hope life is beautiful
 You were the light for me to find my truth
 I just wanna say, thank you

[Dan Caplen:]
 Leaving to find my soul
 Told her I had to go
 And I know it ain't pretty
 When our hearts get broke
 Too young to feel this old
 Watching us both turn cold
 Oh, I know it ain't pretty
 When two hearts get broke
 Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
 When two hearts get broke

[Jess Glynne:]
 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days
 These days
 These days, these days
 These days, these days

[Dan Caplen & Jess Glynne:]
 Three years of ups and downs
 Nothing to show for it now
 And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
 Calling me when I'm drunk
 Remind me of what I've done
 And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

 Oh I know, I know
 Oh I know, I know
 Oh I know, I know
 These days, these days
 Oh I know, I know
 Oh I know, I know
 Oh I know, I know
 To these days, these days

[Macklemore:]
 Cigarettes in the ashtray
 Reminiscing on those past days
 I thought you'd end up with my last name
 But that changed
 And I traveled around the world
 Think where you living at now?
 I heard you moved to Austin
 Got an apartment and settled down
 And every once in a while
 I start texting
 Write a paragraph
 But then I delete the message
 Think 'bout you like a past time
 I could cry you a river
 Get you baptised or
 I wasn't ready to act right
 Used to always think I'd get you back, right
 They say that things fall apart
 We were gonna move to Brooklyn
 You were gonna study Art
 Love is just a tool
 To remind us who we are
 And that we are not alone
 And we're walking in the dark

[Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen:]
 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
 We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts, wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toast
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turn my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer 
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter 
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers

I told you long ago on the road
I got what they're waiting for

I don't run from nothing, dog (Ayy, ayy)

The same way that the rain falls
I ain't gon' lie, you got it all, all, all, all, all of me

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Uh, loves all of you, like I'm John Legend or somethin'
Better save some room, for my heart, it's a big one
I'ma give it to you, ain't no better mood than you
Really helped me find my groove
Fake hoes come in by the pool
Real ones, there's barely a few
But, somehow I found you
Harmony when I'm around you
Paradise when I'm around you (I'm around you)
These feelings brand new (Feelings brand new)
Lean when you fall, need your, need your love
A million miles, you would walk for me
All four oceans, you would cross for me
Stop sippin' purple potion (For you, babe)
For you (Babe), keep it true, babe (This fire)
If I ever try to leave, you'll be stalkin' me
Won't let any other woman come and talk to me
I'd do the same thing if you leave, honestly
Or I would take your life away

"I wandered to LA
Wandered to LA
True story
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Maybe it's the love, maybe it's the drugs
Maybe it's because my girlfriend is the plug
Cocaine strums like guitar chords
She loves drugs, she goes hardcore
She's hidin' from the truth, it's under the rug
Maybe it's because the lies, they fill her up
You see the ghost on her front porch
You see the blood at her front door
We were doin' Xans in a Honda Accord
Lookin' at the things that we couldn't afford
Fantasies became reality, but only for one of us
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Pillowtalkin' 'bout our future and our dreams
Speakin' 'bout how life ain't really as it seems
Reminiscin' 'bout the days you broke my heart
Thankful that we worked it out, we come so far
Say you gotta give me space and let me breathe
Say you gotta give me lovin', that I need
Still we gotta focus on the little things
Never wanna end up how we used to be
And I don't wanna hear you say-ayy
That you don't want to be me with me
Especially when I need some company
That's why I need you to come for me
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor

"No girl can tell me about my mother
16 shots, we last longer than a ladder
None of them want to talk about their crime boss

So, don't bother, don't mess with my mommy
With my mommy, with my mommy
You really think that you are tough, say you're tougher than me
If trouble starts tonight, you won't sleep
Pop on, cut off, makes you look like a creep
They say they want a bad girl, but there are none
 
They are going to put their hands on a girl
They are going to put their hands on her

What I am going to do, no one is prepared for
 
No girl can tell me about my mother

Take one shot, if you think they are men
Take two shots, if you feel they are a gangster
Take three shots, if you think they are idiots
Take four shots if you are a couple
Take five shots, if anyone thinks they are tough

 Yea I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in TriBeCa
 right next to Deniro, but I'll be hood forever
 I'm the new Sinatra, and... since I made it here
 I can make it anywhere, yea, they love me everywhere
 I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicano's
 right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's
 Took it to my stashbox, 560 State St.
 catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons with them Pastry's
 Cruisin' down 8th St., off white Lexus
 drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
 Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
 now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
 Say what's up to Ty-Ty, still sippin' mai tai's
 sittin' courtside, Knicks & Nets give me high five
 Nigga I be Spike'd out, I could trip a referee
 Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from....

 New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
 There's nothin' you can't do
 Now you're in New York
 These streets will make you feel brand new
 Big lights will inspire you
 Let's hear it for New York, New York,
 New York
 
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
 Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
 Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
 You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
 but I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
 Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
 Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
 Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
 for foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act
 8 million stories, out there in it naked
 City, it's a pity, half of y'all won't make it
 Me, I got a plug, Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
 If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
 Three dice cee-lo, three Card Monty
 Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
 Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
 Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire State that's
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
 Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
 so they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
 lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
 then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple eve
 Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
 Anna Wintour gets cold, in Vogue with your skin out
 City of sin, it's a pity on the wind
 Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
 Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
 Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
 Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
 And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
 Came here for school, graduated to the high life
 Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
 MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
 The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
 One hand in the air for the big city
 Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
 No place in the world that could compare
 Put your lighters in the air

You're not even speaking to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were looking forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers

He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing

Took him out to Belgium, welcome

And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'

Uh, you weren't
with me on the cold block nights
Now you front row for the spotlight
Now the diamonds in the Audemars bright
Jets overseas for a far flight
Young nigga on bullshit,
and I ball on 'em, Bill Cartwright
Knew I could shine through the darkness
I guess I always been a star type
That lion in me made my heart fight
Coulda been a victim of a opp pipe
Took a million risks just to get to this
'Cause we ain't the ones that the cops like
Been so many timеs God tested me
Thеy only see the answers I got right
They commentin' all on the blogs
Tryna tell me how to live my life
And I waited so patiently
If you could take off, don't wait for me
No days off, grind faithfully
I keep thankin' God for savin' me
Front line, showcasin' our bravery
I know that top spot, it was made for me
It all paid off,
so we felt the struggle so painfully

wearin' the big body

It was hella times where I failed

Bet he don't double back when he tell
'Cause it ain't no comin' back when you tell
Why would you leave me here by myself?
A nigga be lonely
Ayy, I blew the whole bag on they flights,
ain't leavin' the homies
If he really gang, then get him a chain,
no cubic zirconies
Why's arm in a stogie, stood firm,
never folded
Furthest thing from a rodent,
you put the jacket on and you bogus

Got all this bread
I'm still sourdough (Sour tho')
I don't know, square peg, round hole
Like a block of cheese in a paper towel roll
Rocky Balboa, never been no towel thrower
Even when I got kicked to the curb
Life knocked my dick in the dirt
I got back up, flipped it the bird
'Til I earned the attention I yearned
Not to mention, I learned
How to turn resentment
and hurt to an unquenchable thirst
In the simplest terms,
it's revenge of the nerd
In every sense of the word
But all you see is the fame and the millions
You don't see the strength, the resilience
How I rack my brain, but it feels as if
I'm tryin' to explain it to children
So a lot of this pain isn't healin'
No escapin' it, this anger is spillin'
Almost like recreatin' the feelin'
Of 911 when the second plane
hit the buildin'
So let 'em paint me the villain
Some of this just may be a symptom
Of havin' way too much income
But when you struggled
every day just to get some
Now all of this hate is a syndrome
When they can't relate and that stems from
Money lookin' like it grows on trees
Yeah, they're green, but those aren't leaves
Sufficed to say, with every sacrifice I made
It's like I gave up my life to fame
All the nights that I lied awake
Nights I stayed up to write and prayed
Had to claw, scratch, and fight my way
Just follow me and I'll light the way
Look to the hook if your sky look grey
And rappers, how can we be
On the same level now
when I gotta look down and see these
Clowns that are on the ground?
Bitch, I got clouds beneath me
Ever since I put out the EP
to the height of 2003-me
You ain't see the struggle to make it
out The D.
Because I made it somehow look easy
Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive

"I spent the whole day in my head

Do a little spring cleanin'

I'm always too busy dreamin'

Well maybe I should wake up instead

A lot of things I regret

But I just say I forget

Why can't it just be easy?

Why does everybody need me to stay?

Oh I hate the feeling

When you're high but

You're underneath the ceiling

Got the cards in my hand I hate dealing Yeah

Get everything I need then I'm gone

But it ain't stealing

Can I get a break?

I wish that I could just

Get out my goddamn way

What is there to say?

There ain't a better time than today

But maybe I'll lay down for a little yeah

Instead of always trying

To figure everything out

And all I do is say sorry

Half the time I don't even

Know what I'm saying it about

Good news good news good news

That's all they wanna hear

No they don't like you when I'm down

But when I'm flying oh

It make 'em so uncomfortable

So different what's the difference?

Well it ain't that bad

It could always be worse

I'm running out of gas

Hardly anything left

Hope I make it home from work

Well so tired of being so tired

Why I gotta build something beautiful just

To go set it on fire?

I'm no liar but

Sometimes the truth don't

Sound like the truth

Maybe 'cause it ain't

I just love the way it sound when I say it

Yeah it's what I do

If you know me it ain't anything new

Wake up to the moon

Haven't seen the sun in a while

But I heard that the sky's still blue Yeah

I heard they don't talk about

Me too much no more

And that's a problem with a closed door

Good news good news good news

That's all they wanna hear

No they don't like you when I'm down

But when I'm flying oh

It make 'em so uncomfortable

So different what's the difference?

There's a whole lot more for

Me waiting on the other side

I'm always wondering if

It feel like summer

I know maybe I'm too late

I could make it there some other time

I'll finally discover

That there's a whole lot

More for me waiting

That there's a whole lot

More for me waiting

I know maybe I'm too late

I could make it there some other time

Then I'll finally discover

That it ain't that bad ain't so bad

When it ain't that bad mm

At least it don't gotta be no more

No more no more no more no more

Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

[Travie McCoy:]
Gym class heroes baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

[Travie McCoy:]
Let's go!
If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

[Bridge:]
I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

[Chorus:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh (Gym Class Heroes baby!) to sing along to my stereo

I tie the Chanel runners, then I get back to running the city
And I know that it's hell coming, I ain't worried, my niggas, they with me
Gotta put the narcotics down, I can feel 'em fucking up my kidney
And punching my liver
If I let it kill me, my mama'll never forgive me
Ain't numbing my feelings, if I let it kill 'em, my baby will never forgive me
This remind me of hell, sometimes I wonder if that's where God really sent me
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn

I pray to God for some water to wash down these Percs
I been cursed since birth, guess I never learn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
I pray to God for some water to wash down these Percs
I been cursed since birth, guess I never learn
The truth hurts, let it bleed out, if they hurt you, let 'em leave
My heart hurtin', let me bleed out, only way I'll find peace
I'm tryna get set free, but these chains on me
Choke me, I can't breathe, what's reality?
Uh, detached from myself
Uh-huh, numb the pain with my wealth
Uh, a bag from Chanel match the double C on my belt, uh
Bands in my pants, I barely be holdin' my pants up
But the money ain't the answer
I'm just tryna reach some new highs
Mix this with that, bet it feel nice
Codeine, only sip if I got ice
Look my girl in her eyes, tell her I won't die
I fell asleep too deep that one time
Woke up to your cry, girl, I'm fine
But I lied
Had a dream, I wasn't gon' wake up this time
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn
Hands up in the fire, burn, burn, burn, burn

Cause on a one-to-ten she's a certified twenty, 
And that just aint me. 

Cause I do know 
If I take that chance just where is it gonna lead,
But what I do know is the way 
She dance makes shorty alright with me.

Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends

Still remember when I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone calling on 'cause I got deep pants

And never fazed by names, that they might call me
But they gon' respect it

Here I go, on a new trip, here I go, actin' too lit
Here I go, actin' too rich, here I go, with a new chick

Hard to find what the truth is but the truth was that the truth suck

Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, it was all so simple

Some vodka that will jumpstart
my heart quicker

When I'm rocking the table
while he's operating ""Hey""
You waited this long to stop debating
Cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart
problem is complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Yo let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on dip, bum on your lips
jump back, jiggle her hip and wiggle a bit
And get ready cuz this is about to get heavy

Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis

Til someone comes along on a mission
and yells ""_itch""

could start a revolution,
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask,
In the fact that I got everyone
kissing my a--
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much
of my a-- you ask for me?
Well I'm back (*Batman Noise*)
fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter
Into the front of your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting,
the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing ""Attention Please""
Feel the tension soon as soon
someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Let go, it's over, nobody listens to techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I will be there with a whole list full
of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself
into a symbol
But sometimes man it just seems,
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting,
But its just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley,
To do Black Music so selflessly
And use it to get myself worthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

"[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—


[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Malevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', ""L-L-L-Let us in!""
L-L-Like like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of the motel then
Dr. Dre said ""hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit them with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—


[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I’m
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

(W-W-When they get bit with the—)


[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it is just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to you
When you're bit with the—

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

Order '42 for the table, let's pop shit
Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back

Go to your place, no face, no case
Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me
Actin' like you winnin', if you think about it, actually
Are they supportin' you or really just attackin' me?

My pen a freak, it'll go after a bitch or a nigga (Huh)
Big bank take lil' bank, bitch, add it up
Hoes takin' shots, but they ain't in my caliber
Booked, but I squeeze a lil' head in my calendar
Lookin' in the mirror like, ""Damn, I don't brag enough""
LVs, double C's, Birkins, I'm workin'
My chain ain't hittin' if a bitch ain't hurtin'
Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch
One thing I know, two things for certain
None of these hoes sayin' shit to my face
And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talkin' all the shit that I want
And I dare one of these hoes come tell me I can't
We ain't even speakin' if the nigga ain't spendin'

"Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No, I can't stop

So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You, look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay, and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
moved to the city in a broke down car and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No, I can't stop

Why don't you come on over

"[Verse 1: Simon Aldred]
Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated

[Pre-Chorus: Simon Aldred]
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

[Chorus: Simon Aldred]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

[Verse 2: Simon Aldred]
We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If theres love in this life we're unstoppable
No we can't be defeated

Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love

I never meant to leave you hurting

Been dancing on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause baby you're the only one I'm coming for

I wanna fxxx, but i'm broken hearted
Cry but I like to party
Touch but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna fxxx, but i'm broken hearted
Cry since the day we parted
Touch but I got nobody

Every single night I lose it
I can't even hear the music 
Without you

Try to stop myself from calling
But I really wanna know if you're 
With someone new

Since you've been gone

"Hey, once upon a younger year
 When all our shadows disappeared
 The animals inside came out to play
 Hey, when face to face with all our fears
 Learned our lessons through the tears
 Made memories we knew would never fade

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let it slip away
 He took me in his arms, I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.
 My father told me when I was just a child
 These are the nights that never die
 My father told me



 When thunder clouds start pouring down
 Light a fire they cant put out
 Carve your name into those shinning stars
 He said, Go venture far beyond these shores.
 Dont forsake this life of yours.
 Ill guide you home no matter where you are.

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let this slip away.
 When I was just a kid I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.
 My father told me when I was just a child
 These are the nights that never die
 My father told me

 These are the night that never die

Sellin' a dream

Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go never let me down

All that we need
Is a rude awakening to

"Hello, it's me your ex
I called to say not sorry, but I wish you the best

You got the face of an angel

Girl, you play me like a fool

Why I fall hard, no parachute?
Gave you my heart, and my heart and soul
Gave you the time and affection you wanted

You told me to show I was true
But you broke my heart into two, ah
I should've read, I should've read from the signs
Everything we had was a lie

"I’ve been hearing symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo singing on my own
Now I can’t find the key without you

And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

And baby if we get tired
We'll just start locking our faces

Hold your breath and feel the tension

cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick em to the curb unless 
they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

Now, now, we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

I will be your remedy

"[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go",Eminem,Venom (Music From The Motion Picture)

I'm still all alone
How could this be?
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold?
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear

And says that

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear

And says that

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Oh,whisper three words
And I'll come runnin' and I'll
And girl, you know
That I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone",Britney Spears,Toxic

"I know we've been close since we were kids
And you used to swing my way, knock my door, come out to play
You'd tell me everything I'm always listening
To the stories that we made while we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's gеtting louder and the drinks are gеtting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I'm singing hallelujah
I think my shirt would suit ya
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

It happens every time that we go out
Wish that I could walk you home, instead I text you on your phone
Some drunken message that I know that I'll regret
It was simple in the days, when we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's getting louder and the drinks are getting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I'm singing hallelujah

"Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, 
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us 
into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, 
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us 
into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go 
(I won't let go, no no, no no no no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope someone come 
and take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know you won't let go

Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
그녀는 제가 당신께 주지 못했던 것들도 줬나 봐요

오랜 친구여 왜 그렇게 수줍어 하나요

Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

전 멀리할 수도 없었고 그러려고 (저 자신과) 싸울 수도 없었어요

전 바랐었죠 당신이 제 얼굴을 보고

And that you'd be reminded that for me

You know how the time flies
아시잖아요, 시간이 얼마나 빨리 흐르는지

Only yesterday was the time of our lives
우리가 살아온 시간이 어제가 다 인 것 같아요

We were born and raised in a summer haze
우린 여름 안개 속에서 태어나서 자랐어요

Bound by the surprise of our glory days
눈부신 나날들 속의 놀라움에 빠진 채로..

Better conversation, with no limitation
Got no time to play it like a station, ayy

Taste the you, give a nigga déjà vu
Welcome back I feel like Ma$e did too, true

"The last few months, 
I've been working on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones 
who loved me, baby
I look back now and realize
I remember when I held you
You begged me 
with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Gimme one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like 
I should've loved you all the time
I remember when I held you 
(Held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning 
eyes to stay (Never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
Oh, singing, out of time
Said I had you to myself
But I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
Out of time
Out of time
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, 
you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely 
engulfed in the blissful 
embrace of that little light 
you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, 
forgiven and refreshed

"There's a fire starting in my heart
제 맘속에 분노의 불꽃이 타오르기 시작했어요

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
활활 타오르면서, 절 어둠 속으로부터 나오게 했어요

Finally, I can see you crystal clear
이제서야 당신이란 인간이 분명히 보이네요

Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your sheet bare
계속 절 팔고 다녀봐요, 저도 당신을 다 까발릴테니까

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
어떻게 당신 모든 걸 가지고 떠나는 지 두고 봐요

Don't underestimate the things that I will do
제가 어떻게 할 지 우습게 생각하지 않는게 (좋을거에요)



There's a fire starting in my heart
제 맘속에 분노의 불꽃이 타오르기 시작했어요

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
활활 타오르면서, 절 어둠 속으로부터 나오게 했어요

The scars of your love remind me of us
사랑의 상처들이 우리를 돌아보게 만들어요

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
그 상처들이 우리가 모든걸 가졌었다고 생각나게 하네요

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
사랑의 상처 들이 절 숨막히게 해요

I can't help feeling
제가 그렇게 느낄 수 밖에 없어요



We could have had it all
우린 전부 가질 수도 있었어요

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
(당신은 절 만나지 않았었으면 생각 할테지만요)

Rolling in the deep
깊이 빠져들면서

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
(눈물이 날거에요, 깊이 빠져들면서)



You had my heart inside of your hand
당신은 제 심장을 손에 쥐고

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
(당신은 절 만나지 않았었으면 생각 할테지만)

And you played it, to the beat
제 마음을 조종했죠, 심장박동에 맞춰서...

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
(눈물이 날거에요, 깊이 빠져들면서)



Baby, I have no story to be told
제가 당신께 들려 줄 얘기는 없지만

But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
당신에 관한 얘기를 하나 들었고, 난 당신을 화나게 할 작정이에요

Think of me in the depths of your despair
깊은 절망에 빠져 저를 생각해보세요

Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
저 처럼 그 절망 속에서 살아봐요, 당연히 같이 할 생각은 없어요

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
(당신은 절 만나지 않았었으면 생각 할테지만요)

The scars of your love remind me of us
사랑의 상처들이 우리를 돌아보게 만들어요

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
그 상처들이 우리가 모든걸 가졌었다고 생각나게 하네요

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
사랑의 상처 들이 절 숨막히게 해요

I can't help feeling
제가 그렇게 느낄 수 밖에 없어요



We could have had it all
우린 전부 가질 수도 있었어요

You had my heart inside of your hand
당신은 제 심장을 손에 쥐고

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
(당신은 절 만나지 않았었으면 생각 할테지만)

And you played it, to the beat
제 마음을 조종했죠, 심장박동에 맞춰서...

You had my heart inside of your hand

제 마음을 조종했죠, 심장박동에 맞춰서...

Throw your soul through every open door
문이 열려 있다면 당신의 영혼을 버리세요

Count your blessings to find what you look for
당신께 주어진 축복을 헤아려봐요, 바라는 무언가를 얻는 축복을...

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
제 슬픔을 소중한 금으로 돌려놓으세요

You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
당신이 한 만큼 돌려 받고, 뿌린만큼 거두게 될거에요

"We're going back in time
I'd like to see you try
Unpacking thoughts through 
tunnels in your mind
I'll fix you mushroom tea
And cross the restless sea
Release yourself to escape reality
It doesn't phase you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual
Seeking approval
Begging for it desperately
I said
How do I make you love me?
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me? (Oh, ah)
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me (Oh, ah)
And make it last eternally?
I can see the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And all the things you tolerated
Made you cold inside
But I can light you up again
Like embers of a fire
It doesn't phase you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual

Suit and tie, and cigar smokes
Macallan shots 'til it burn throats
We still celebrating Super Bowl
Catalog looking legendary
Ring froze like it's February
XO, that's a mercenary
A quarter bill on an off-year
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruising on a yacht, 
we clear, yeah
Said you wanted 
your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics
And you didn't expect to fall for me 
once you got this dick
The city dark, city dangerous
Your girlfriend's tryna pair you 
with somebody more famous
But instead you ended up 
with someone so basic, faceless
Someone to take your pictures and frame it
And my new girl, she a movie star
My new girl, she a movie star
I loved her right, make her scream 
like Neve Campbell
But when I make her laugh, 
swear it cures my depressing thoughts
'Cause baby girl, she a movie star
Baby girl, she a movie star
I told myself that I'd never fall
But here we go again
Oh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again
Although this love is strong to me
Some things can change, go wrong with me
We don't know how it's gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We don't need the government i
nvolved because we like to touch
We don't need no damn religion 
telling us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road,

And in my, my heart won't take no more
I know you say that I don't care
Sometimes my way of life ain't fair
I feel it's sad for me you take the chance
So you are givin' me no choice
I think I must exercise my voice and say

And it's like raising kids, man
If you weren't raised,

I could with them because 
they know fuckin' well I love them
But I didn't do the best 
I could — I didn't know what the fuck 
I was doing — I didn't

my mother get 
put in a straightjacket and taken 
out of my home 
when I was only seven years old
She was diagnosed with Dementia 
praecox and put in a mental institution 
leaving my daddy alone 
with me and my little brothеr Lloyd
I later had an evil stepmothеr 
who further cemented the idea 
that I didn't need a mother
Growing up without one had long 
lasting impressions I didn't fully 
understand until much later in life
It bled into my relationships 
with family and those 
I had became romantically involved with
Whenever I got too close to a woman, 
I would cut her off
Part of that was vindictive and partially 
based on fear, 
but it was also totally subconsious

I never thought I was bold enough
You pushed me further
And I take the blame for the both of us

Keep that away from me

No empathy, especially when the kid off Hennessy

Make the fool come out like, ""Who is he?""

but leave before the morning comes
Even though it's what we want,
can't keep this up for long
But I just, I just don't wanna leave you
Might just,
might just throw away the reasons
Why we both can't lay here
And secret, secret, both gotta keep it
Honest, honest, that's just a game
We know we both can't play
For tonight, I'm yours
So deny the truth
We'll stay behind closed doors
'Cause all I wanna do is lie with you
Even though it's wrong to lie with you
We've become numb to what
we know is wrong
But no one knows but us
The feelings rush every single time we touch
Even though it's what we want,
can't keep this up for long
But I just, I just don't wanna leave you
Might just,
might just throw away the reasons
Why we both can't lay here
And secret, secret, both gotta keep it
Honest, honest, that's just a game
We know (Know), we both can't play
For tonight, I'm yours (I'm yours)
So deny the truth (Deny the truth)

"Remember those walls I built
Well baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest noght
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now

That´s marked July 15th
Because since there´s no more you
There´s no more anniversary

And your memory

"Why I love to give you flowers on a Wednesday, 12 dozen roses at your door.

Or even light some candles when you come over for dinner, I wouldn’t mind to light a billion more.

Or how I like to wake up and see you with no make up, I’d still give you a ring the way you are. 

Or stay up on the phone late at night when you’re alone, looking out the window gazing up at stars.

Chorus: 
So if you’re wondering why I do the things that I do, honestly I don’t know what to say.

All these questions and answers, I just like to have her, every moment every single day.

Verse Two:
Why I love to hold you even in the public, you could call it lovely PDA.

I don’t care what city, you could pick out of the 50 states like California in the bay.

Or how I like to take you to church on every Sunday, holding hands together as we pray.

I dont care if people hate, I dont care what people say, cause my love for you will always be the same.

Chorus: 
So if you’re wondering why I do the things that I do, honestly I don’t know what to say.

All these questions and answers, I just like to have her, every moment every single day.

"Lately I`ve had the strangest feeling

With no very reason here to find

Yet the thought of losing you`s been hanging

around my mind

Far more frequently you`re wearing perfume

With you say `No special place to go`

But when I ask, will you be coming back soon

You don`t know, never know

Well, I`m a man of many wishes

Hope my premonition misses

But what I really feel

My eyes won`t let me hide

`Cause they always start to cry

`Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I`ve been staring in the mirror

Very slowly picking me apart

Trying to tell myself I have no reason

with your heart

Just the other night while you were sleeping

I vaguely heard you whisper someone`s name

But, when I asked you other the thoughts you`re keeping

You just said `Nothing`s changed`

Well,I`m a man of many wishes

I hope my premonition misses

what I really feel

최근에 난 이상한 감정을 갖게 되었어요

특별히 명백한 이유는 없지만

당신을 잃을 것 같다는 생각을 떨칠 수 없어요.

내 마음 주위로

요즘 당신은 향수를 자주 사용하는군요

‘어디갈 특별한 이유는 없어' 라고 말하면서

""곧 돌아올 거죠?"" 라고 내가 물으면

당신은 말합니다. 모른다, 절대 모른다고.

난 많은 소원을 가진 남자랍니다

나의 예감이 틀리기를 바라지만

내가 정말 느끼는 것을

나의 눈은 숨기지 못하죠

왜냐면 항상 눈물이 나오니깐

왜냐면 이번에는 아마 당신과 이별을 해야 하니까요

(오 나에게 이야기해 주세요)

최근에 난 거울 속을 들여다 보기 시작했죠

매우 천천히 나를 조각조각 내면서

나 자신에게 무슨 이유가 있다고 말하면서

당신의 마음을 잡지 못한 것은

그대여, 당신이 잠자고 있었던 지난 날 밤에

당신이 희미하게 누군가의 이름을 부르는 것을 들었어요

그러나 내가 당신에게 어떤 생각을 하고 있는 가를 물었을 때

당신은 무심코 말했어요 ‘변한 건 없어!'

난 많은 소원을 가진 남자랍니다

나의 예감이 틀리기를 바라지만

내가 정말 느끼는 것을

나의 눈은 숨기지 못하죠

왜냐면 항상 눈물이 나오니깐 (예,예 그대여)

왜냐면 이번에는 아마 당신과 이별을 해야 하니까",NCT 127,Highway to Heaven (English Ver.)

And beaten
Yeah the world knows how to break you down
But when pain blurs my vision
I won't worry
Because you always turn it back around

When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my Center you keep me tethered

"You're turned in to Dawn FM
The middle of nowhere on your dial
So sit back and unpack
You may be here awhile
Now that all future plans 
have been postponed
And it's time to look back 
on the things you thought you owned
Do you remember them well?
Were you high or just stoned?
And how many grudges 
did you take to your grave?
When you weren't liked or followed, 
how did you behave?
Was it often a dissonant 
chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune 
with the song life was humming?
If pain's living on 
when your body's long gone
And your phantom regret hasn't 
let it go yet
You may not have died in the way 
that you must
All specters are haunted by their 
own lack of trust
When you're all out of time, 
there's nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering
No nations, no race
And Heaven is closer than those 
tears on your face
When the purple rain falls
We are all bathed in it's grace
Heaven's for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here 
when you're not all there yet
But you could be there 
by the end of this song
Where The Weeknd's 
so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on
And if your broken heart's heavy 
when you step on the scale
You'll be lighter than air 
when they pull back the vail
Consider the flowers, 
they don't try to look right
They just open their 
petals and turn to the light
Are you listening real close?
Heaven's not that, it's this
It's the depth of this moment
We don't reach for bliss
God knows life is chaos
But He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind
Train your soul to align
And dance 'til you find that divine boogaloo
In other words
You gotta be Heaven, to see Heaven
May peace be with you",SZA,I Hate U

Just passing time
losing my mind
Hours of scrolling

Bored doing nothing with you
I'd rather be up in my bed
Watching some Netflix

I made peace with myself, at one with it
I can't let a goofy nigga come dump in it
I told boy shoot his shot, bust guns in it (Brrr)
I mean I know that you feelin' me, I can tell that you feelin' me
Acting like you was deadin' me, boy, you really be killin' me
How you diggin' me, iggin' me, boy, you gotta be shittin' me

"Hello, it's me
안녕, 저에요.

I was wondering if after all these years
전 궁금했어요 이 모든 시간이 지나고 나도

You'd like to meet, to go over everything
절 만나서 우리의 모든걸 돌이켜 보고 싶어할지 말이에요

They say that time's supposed to heal ya
시간이 모든걸 치유해 준다고들 하지만

But I ain't done much healing
저는 그러지 못하네요.



Hello, can you hear me?
여보세요, 듣고 있어요?

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
전 우리가 예전에 꿈꾸었던 캘리포니아에 있어요,

When we were younger and free
우리가 더 젊고 자유로웠던 예전에...

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
전 잊었어요 세상이 우리 발밑에 있다고 느끼던 기분이 어땠는지를...

There's such a difference between us and a million miles
우리 사이에는 백만마일 만큼이나 거리가 있어요



Hello from the other side
전화기 너머로 들려오는 Hello

I must've called a thousand times to tell you
당신께 이말을 하려고 천번이나 전화한게 분명해요

I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
지금껏 제가 벌인 모든 것에 대하여 미안하다고

But when I call you never seem to be home
하지만, 그 때마다 당신은 집에 없었어요



Hello from the outside
전화기 너머로 들려오는 Hello

At least I can say that I've tried
적어도 제가 애썼다고 말할 수 있어요.

To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
당신께 상처 줘서 미안하다고 말하기 위해 애썼다고...

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
하지만, 상관 없어요. 더이상 당신은 상처 받지 않을 테니까.



Hello, how are you?
안녕, 잘 지내시죠?

It's so typical of me to talk about myself
늘 이런식으로 내 얘기를 하네요

I'm sorry, I hope that you're well
미안, 당신이 잘 지내시길 바래요



Did you ever make it out of that town
그 마을을 떠난 것이

Where nothing ever happened?
아무일도 일어나지 않아서 인가요?

It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time
우리 둘이 시간을 허비하고 있다는게 비밀도 아니에요

and fun everything we do me and you

with the windows down like Gs
we dont care whose around or who sees
and everyone is jealous of my ride 
because youre sitting in the passengers side

Its the simple things you do
i just cant get enough of you
its that perfume that you wear
and the way you do your hair
that i love so much
its the simple things you say
and how in bed we play
its the way you kiss my cheek
when you think that Im asleep
i love it so much

Everyday scrubbing it lovin it
crusin freeways in our PJs c
cause thats the fun of it unless
you wear that pretty black dress o yes
catch me in a suit so i can look as good as you
but i dont owell 
with that smile that you wear so well
and the way that you cry in movies
pass you the ball and pass it back to me
beers with the guys 
aint no thing
its your eyes and the simple things
that make this work like it should
when you rock my shirt
o you look so good 
so take my hand n stay as long as you can w the man
that tells all the jokes only you understand

When you're screaming,
but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road
that goes both ways
When your tears roll down
your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be
there for me too

But you gotta be
there for me too

But I'm holding on
to something
Wake up if you feel nothing
I'm running, running,
just to keep my hands on you
There was a time
that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you
I'm running, running,
just to keep my hands on you
Running, running,
just to keep my hands on you
Running, running,
just to keep my hands on you
So I'm running, running,
just to keep my hands on you
But you gotta be
there for me too

But you gotta be
there for me too","Aaliyah, The Weeknd",Poison
"What's the trick I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through 
all the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look you do
and I run right back to you
You crossed the line and 
it's time to say F you
What's the point in saying that 
when you know how I'll react
You think you can just take it back 
but shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to 
and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you 
and that's that
'Cause when it all falls down 
then whatever
When it don't work out 
for the better
If we just ain't right 
and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down 
when it all falls down
I'll be fine I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad 
but I'll be fine
Why we fight I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh I tried staying cold 
but you take it personal
All these firing shots and 
making grounder
It's way too hard to cope 
but I still can't let you go
'Cause when it all falls down 
then whatever
When it don't work out 
for the better
If we just ain't right 
and it's time to say goodbye

There’s just one thing

Girl you could have anyone
So why you choosing me and not leaving me on my own
Girl you could be with anyone
So thanks for making me your number one

You can keep me warm on a cold night

"Lily was a little girl 
Afraid of the big , wide world
She grew up within her castle walls

Now and then she tried to run
And then oh the  night with the setting sun
She went in the woods away 
So afraid , all alone

They warned her , Don't go there
There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
Then something came creeping it told her

Don't you worry just follow everywhere i go 
top over the mountains of valley low 
Give you everything you ' ve been dreaming of 

Just let me in , ooh 
Everything you wanted gotta be the magic 
Story you've been told and you ' ll be safe under my control
Just let me in

Just let me in 

She knew she was  hypnotised
And walking on cold thin ice
Then it broke , and she awoke again

Then she ran faster than 
Start screming, is there someone out there ? 
Please help me , come get me 
Behind her , she can hear it say 

Follow everywhere i go 
Top over the mountains of valley low 
Give you everything you ' ve been dreaming of 
Just let me in , ooh 

Everything you wanted gotta be the magic 
story you ' ve been told 
And you ' ll be safe under my control

You make me candles
Nothing I would think can stop us now

"I met you in a bar in San Francisco
Said you used to have a car before the repo
Smoking Lucky cigarettes, I think the smoke went to my head
And now that summer night plays on repeat

We climbed the Golden Gate bridge just to watch the stars collide
And played that Stevie Wonder song a couple thousand times
I'm kinda scared to say it was the best night of my life
But I know I won't forget San Francisco
No, I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget that night in San Francisco
In San Francisco
In San Francisco

I met you in a bar in San Francisco
But when the sun came up we had to let go
When you took that Greyhound bus
Thought it was the end of us
But now, you're all I dream of when I sleep

We climbed the Golden Gate bridge just to watch the stars collide
And played that Stevie Wonder song a couple thousand times
I'm kinda scared to say it was the best night of my life

아무리 막아도 결국 너의 곁인 걸
길고 긴 여행을 끝내 이젠 돌아가

To come and blind us
Let's just believe their lies
Believe it, I see it
I know that you can feel
No secrets worth keeping
So fool me like I'm dreaming

Wanna dance you out of my (gotta dance you out of my) hips, my thighs, my wrongs, my rights

"[Intro: Patrick Stump]

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]

She looks good in the morning

And she don't even know it

I don't want you to go yet

Can we stay in the moment?

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes

When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like

You look good in the morning

And you don't even know it

I knew that

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

[Verse 2: Macklemore]

Sundress with you on my arm

Take the coupe out the garage

Pull the roof back just me, you and the stars

Toast to the Gods

She's the one, a masterpiece

She a drug got a fast release

Got me sprung wrapped in sheets

Wake up, fuck, and then we going back to sleep

[Verse 3: Macklemore]

Me and you on an island

With the ocean color stuck in your iris

We're comfortable in silence

But I prefer when we wilding

Sundress, nothing underneath as we undress

You could look in my eyes see I'm some mess

Couple of broken people

Trying to complete each other

Under one breath

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes

When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like

You look good in the morning

And you don't even know it

I knew that

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

She could be the one",H.E.R.,Best Part (Feat. Daniel Caesar)

"I’ve been hearing symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo singing on my own
Now I can’t find the key without you

And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

And I was runnin' out of luck

"Waiting for the time 
to pass you by
Hope the winds of change 
will change your mind
I could give a 
thousand reasons why
And I know you, 
and you've got to

Make it on your own, 
but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, 
drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand 
reasons why
But you're going, 
and you know that

All you have to do is 
stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to is 
wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay

Won't admit 
what I already know
I've never been the best 
at letting go
I don't wanna spend 
the night alone
Guess I need you, 
and I need to

Make it on my own, 
but I don't wanna grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, 
drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a 
million reasons why
But you're going, 
and you know that

All you have to do is 
stay a minute
Just take your time

All you have to is

All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay

All you have to do is stay
So stay, yeah

You shout it out
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

Fire away, fire away

But it's you who have further to fall

"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the ""Get Well Soon"" cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But, mom, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces. It's tearing me up but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""
Hallelujah, you're home
I fluffed the pillows
made the beds
stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive
then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""
Hallelujah, you're home
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
he said, ""Hallelujah, you're home""",Lucky Daye,Candy Drip

Oh love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Cold hands red eyes
Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks

Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
Been waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside

And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

And you whisper I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don't talk
And if they could they'd say

Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

If I had a diamond heart

Don't tell me that you could
don't tell me that you could
It's beautiful in a way with love
But what's a girl to do
when you can't seem to choose?
You're beautiful but your mind's restrained
When your mind is split two ways is
when the comedown plays

Don't touch me
Boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you
I'm waiting
And I'm patient
I'm deluded
You have someone that loves you

Touch me touch me
touch me touch me
You have someone that loves you

You want me close so I hear you
I thought I made it clear
don't whisper in my ear
My heart it keeps getting weaker
I know you want me near
but your love is what I fear
It's beautiful the way you move
But what's a boy to do
when he can't seem to choose?
Yeah I'm beautiful
but I must explain
My mind's not in a good place
and so the comedown plays

Don't touch me
Boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you
I'm waiting
And I'm patient
You have someone that loves you
Don't touch me
Boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you
I'm waiting
And I'm patient
I feel stupid
When you have someone that loves you

That loves you
Yeah she loves you too
The way that I do

Don't touch me
Boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you
I'm waiting
And I'm patient
You have someone that loves you
Don't touch me
Boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you
I'm waiting
And I'm patient
I feel stupid
When you have someone that loves you

That loves you
When you have someone that loves you
That loves you
When you have someone that loves you
That loves you
When you have someone that loves you
That loves you

"I was playing on the beach with my best friends band
And it was such a bummer, yeah
The way that you left before I got a chance
To tell you that you're wavy like the water when the tide is rolling in
Those seashells in your hair l'll hear the ocean when we kiss
I think I'm crazy bout the way that you tug on your sweater
When it don't fit just right but I think that that's better
I miss the sunshine
Not the heat on the beach
But the way that your eyes, shined on me
I miss the starlight
It wasn't for long
And I'd hoped you'd be here
But you're gone now
Because it's hopeless
I'm at work and I can't focus
And you don't even know this
And you don't even know me
And you didn't even notice
When I held your hand and pulled you on the stage
You put me in hypnosis
You got me in hypnosis baby
I loved the last song
Cause I know it's your favorite
It won't last long
Cause you're always changing
Take some time off
And let's get back to the basics
And know this
Our love will grow post hypnosis
Oh and I'm still dazed
From watching you too closely
I can't think straight
Cause every single morning
I wake up next to nothing and got nowhere to be
Just a couple small chores and a few groceries
And I dance all day picture you in my mind
I'd like to go back in time
And leave my number behind
I miss the sunshine
Not the heat on the beach
But the way that your eyes, shined on me
I miss the starlight

"Ummm, yea
Mirrors they never lie
Don't see myself inside
Why can't I get it right?
I don't know
You're always watching me fall
Shadows they like my wall
Why do I feel so small?
I don't know

So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know

I've lost, I've lost
I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
Ooh

Tired of being afraid
But lately, I've lost my faith
What is love without pain, it ain't home
You're watching me but I'm below
When I get caught I hope
This is kinda like how they will
Take me home

So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know

I've lost, I've lost
I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again

I know that I'm a mess
But I ain't trying to be the best
Oh, whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay
Never said I was an angel
I am damaged all the way
So whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay

 I know you moved onto someone new
 Hope life is beautiful
 You were the light for me to find my truth
 I just wanna say, thank you

[Dan Caplen:]
 Leaving to find my soul
 Told her I had to go
 And I know it ain't pretty
 When our hearts get broke
 Too young to feel this old
 Watching us both turn cold
 Oh, I know it ain't pretty
 When two hearts get broke
 Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
 When two hearts get broke

[Jess Glynne:]
 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days

 These days, these days
 These days, these days

 Three years of ups and downs
 Nothing to show for it now
 And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
 Calling me when I'm drunk
 Remind me of what I've done
 And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

 Cigarettes in the ashtray
 Reminiscing on those past days
 I thought you'd end up with my last name
 But that changed
 And I traveled around the world
 Think where you living at now?
 I heard you moved to Austin
 Got an apartment and settled down
 And every once in a while
 I start texting
 Write a paragraph
 But then I delete the message
 Think 'bout you like a past time
 I could cry you a river
 Get you baptised or
 I wasn't ready to act right
 Used to always think I'd get you back, right
 They say that things fall apart
 We were gonna move to Brooklyn
 You were gonna study Art
 Love is just a tool
 To remind us who we are
 And that we are not alone
 And we're walking in the dark

[Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen:]
 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
 We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts, wish he could, but he can't get close

I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so

Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer

"[Intro: Juice WRLD]
You gotta stay here for this
I love you

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
The girl of my dreams, but I ain't fallin' asleep
Think both of your legs gone, the way you fallin' for me
The same way that the rain falls
I ain't gon' lie, you got it all, all, all, all, all of me

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Uh, loves all of you, like I'm John Legend or somethin'
Better save some room, for my heart, it's a big one
I'ma give it to you, ain't no better mood than you
Really helped me find my groove
Fake hoes come in by the pool
Real ones, there's barely a few
But, somehow I found you
Harmony when I'm around you
Paradise when I'm around you (I'm around you)
These feelings brand new (Feelings brand new)
Lean when you fall, need your, need your love
A million miles, you would walk for me
All four oceans, you would cross for me
Stop sippin' purple potion (For you, babe)
For you (Babe), keep it true, babe (This fire)
If I ever try to leave, you'll be stalkin' me
Won't let any other woman come and talk to me
I'd do the same thing if you leave, honestly
Or I would take your life away

그저 싱그럽다가도 어쩔 땐 차갑네
항상 사랑은 외로움을 동반해
함께 있음에도 외롭게 마찬가지

어쩔 땐 미친놈처럼 많이 웃기도, yeah

"I wandered to LA
Wandered to LA
True story
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Maybe it's the love, maybe it's the drugs
Maybe it's because my girlfriend is the plug
Cocaine strums like guitar chords
She loves drugs, she goes hardcore
She's hidin' from the truth, it's under the rug
Maybe it's because the lies, they fill her up
You see the ghost on her front porch
You see the blood at her front door
We were doin' Xans in a Honda Accord
Lookin' at the things that we couldn't afford
Fantasies became reality, but only for one of us
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Pillowtalkin' 'bout our future and our dreams
Speakin' 'bout how life ain't really as it seems
Reminiscin' 'bout the days you broke my heart
Thankful that we worked it out, we come so far
Say you gotta give me space and let me breathe
Say you gotta give me lovin', that I need
Still we gotta focus on the little things
Never wanna end up how we used to be
And I don't wanna hear you say-ayy
That you don't want to be me with me
Especially when I need some company
That's why I need you to come for me
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Ooh, I'm the elephant in the room
Ooh, ooh, my nightmares are startin' to come true",Alan Walker,Sing Me to Sleep
"No girl can tell me about my mother
16 shots, we last longer than a ladder
None of them want to talk about their crime boss
Put the bodies in a pot, they will burn like grabba*
No boy can diss me or my mother
It isn't safe around here, everyone needs armour
16 shots, we are going to kill any brother
Rah-ta, rah-ta
Ka-kah, ka-kah, ka-kah
Rah-ka-ka-ka-ka-rahh!
 
You couldn't be tougher than a Kingston?
Disrespect my mother, and your skin will start to bleed
So, don't bother, don't mess with my mommy
With my mommy, with my mommy
Baby, think you're tough, say you're tougher than she
If a dog barks, it's been a long time since he's eaten
Rap (music) on, pop (music) off, makes you move like a freak
They say that they are gangsters, but so is mommy
 
They are going to put their hands on a girl
They are going to put their hands on her
Eyes watching when I come through the door
What I am going to do, no one is prepared for
 
No girl can tell me about my mother

You couldn't be madder than Kobe Bryant?
Disrespect my mother and your lips won't move
So, don't bother, don't mess with my mommy
With my mommy, with my mommy
You really think that you are tough, say you're tougher than me
If trouble starts tonight, you won't sleep
Pop on, cut off, makes you look like a creep
They say they want a bad girl, but there are none
 
They are going to put their hands on a girl
They are going to put their hands on her
Eyes watching when I come through the door
What I am going to do, no one is prepared for
 
No girl can tell me about my mother
16 shots, we last longer than a ladder
None of them want to talk about their crime boss
Put the bodies in a pot, they will burn like grabba

Take one shot, if you think they are men
Take two shots, if you feel they are a gangster
Take three shots, if you think they are idiots
Take four shots if you are a couple
Take five shots, if anyone thinks they are tough
Straight ""thump thump"" head lump, you will drop (to the floor)
If you hit up the Da-Da-Da-Don
Bullets are going to hit you wherever you are

 I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicano's
 right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's
 Took it to my stashbox, 560 State St.
 catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons with them Pastry's
 Cruisin' down 8th St., off white Lexus
 drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
 Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
 now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
 Say what's up to Ty-Ty, still sippin' mai tai's
 sittin' courtside, Knicks & Nets give me high five
 Nigga I be Spike'd out, I could trip a referee
 Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from....
 
[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
 New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
 There's nothin' you can't do
 Now you're in New York
 These streets will make you feel brand new
 Big lights will inspire you
 Let's hear it for New York, New York,
 New York
 
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
 Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
 Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
 You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
 but I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
 Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
 Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
 Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
 for foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act
 8 million stories, out there in it naked
 City, it's a pity, half of y'all won't make it
 Me, I got a plug, Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
 If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
 Three dice cee-lo, three Card Monty
 Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
 Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
 Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire State that's
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
 Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
 so they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
 lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
 then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple eve
 Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
 Anna Wintour gets cold, in Vogue with your skin out
 City of sin, it's a pity on the wind
 Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
 Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
 Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
 Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
 And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
 Came here for school, graduated to the high life
 Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
 MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
 The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
 One hand in the air for the big city
 Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
 No place in the world that could compare
 Put your lighters in the air
 Everybody say ""yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah""
 
[Chorus] ",David Guetta,Bad (Radio Edit) (Feat. Vassy)
"You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything (oh wow)

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speaking to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were looking forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything (oh wow)

I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it’s gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything (oh wow)

I promise
I swear to you I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

"Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive
Had to lose it all to win the fight
I had to fall so many times (Oh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the last one standin'
Uh, you weren't
with me on the cold block nights
Now you front row for the spotlight
Now the diamonds in the Audemars bright
Jets overseas for a far flight
Young nigga on bullshit,
and I ball on 'em, Bill Cartwright
Knew I could shine through the darkness
I guess I always been a star type
That lion in me made my heart fight
Coulda been a victim of a opp pipe
Took a million risks just to get to this
'Cause we ain't the ones that the cops like
Been so many timеs God tested me
Thеy only see the answers I got right
They commentin' all on the blogs
Tryna tell me how to live my life
And I waited so patiently
If you could take off, don't wait for me
No days off, grind faithfully
I keep thankin' God for savin' me
Front line, showcasin' our bravery
I know that top spot, it was made for me
It all paid off,
so we felt the struggle so painfully
Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive
Had to lose it all to win the fight
I had to fall so many times (Oh-oh-oh)

Yeah, you know the code we gotta live by
Never mind all the ice cubes on this wrist,
wearin' the big body
Live by the gun, get bodied,
or it's hella time in that cell
It was hella times where I failed
When I had to double back from them Ls
Bet he don't double back when he tell
'Cause it ain't no comin' back when you tell
Why would you leave me here by myself?
A nigga be lonely
Ayy, I blew the whole bag on they flights,
ain't leavin' the homies
If he really gang, then get him a chain,
no cubic zirconies
Why's arm in a stogie, stood firm,
never folded
Furthest thing from a rodent,
you put the jacket on and you bogus
Yeah, big dawg and they know it
I had to spin-off to stay focused
Longev' on the motion
We don't abandon ship when it's hopeless
Sound of the microphone, and they know
I make it look easy
Like I made it overnight
I make it look easy
But you don't see the dark side
And all of the monsters I had to fight (Fight)
And all of the nightmares (Nightmares)
Made me stronger than life (Yeah)
Y'all say I've changed
Really though? How so?
Got all this bread
I'm still sourdough (Sour tho')
I don't know, square peg, round hole
Like a block of cheese in a paper towel roll
Rocky Balboa, never been no towel thrower
Even when I got kicked to the curb
Life knocked my dick in the dirt
I got back up, flipped it the bird
'Til I earned the attention I yearned
Not to mention, I learned
How to turn resentment
and hurt to an unquenchable thirst
In the simplest terms,
it's revenge of the nerd
In every sense of the word
But all you see is the fame and the millions
You don't see the strength, the resilience
How I rack my brain, but it feels as if
I'm tryin' to explain it to children
So a lot of this pain isn't healin'
No escapin' it, this anger is spillin'
Almost like recreatin' the feelin'
Of 911 when the second plane
hit the buildin'
So let 'em paint me the villain
Some of this just may be a symptom
Of havin' way too much income
But when you struggled
every day just to get some
Now all of this hate is a syndrome
When they can't relate and that stems from
Money lookin' like it grows on trees
Yeah, they're green, but those aren't leaves
Sufficed to say, with every sacrifice I made
It's like I gave up my life to fame
All the nights that I lied awake
Nights I stayed up to write and prayed
Had to claw, scratch, and fight my way
Just follow me and I'll light the way
Look to the hook if your sky look grey
And rappers, how can we be
On the same level now
when I gotta look down and see these
Clowns that are on the ground?
Bitch, I got clouds beneath me
Ever since I put out the EP
to the height of 2003-me
You ain't see the struggle to make it
out The D.
Because I made it somehow look easy
Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive

To go set it on fire?

Sound like the truth

Maybe 'cause it ain't

I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka

How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flap of my dollar stack right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)

You're bringin' the killer within me out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me
And be on the receiving end of me, what stupidity it'd be

Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te.
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

[Travie McCoy:]
Gym class heroes baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te

Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

Let's go!
If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te

Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)

"See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know you won't
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be the same young, hungry nigga from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior came with sheepskin
Still remember when I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone calling on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me to wait to beat the game, it's all in defense
And never fazed by names, that they might call me
But they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call
I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart
But I blocked off the exit, yeah
Oh-oh, I know you won't (I know you won't)
I know you won't (Oh, yeah), oh, oh, oh
I know you won't, I know that you look over us
'Til we sound aslee-ee-ee-ee-eep
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, I was up for sale
But I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go, on a new trip, here I go, actin' too lit
Here I go, actin' too rich, here I go, with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonym-est, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, ""What do you love?""
Hard to find what the truth is but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, it was all so simple
I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know you're watching me
Eighty degrees, burning up the leaves
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water

Guess who's back, guess who's back,

I've created a monster, cuz nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady
I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady,
then this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of me mixed
with some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jumpstart
my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked
at the hospital
By the Dr. when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table
while he's operating ""Hey""
You waited this long to stop debating
Cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart
problem is complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Yo let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on dip, bum on your lips
jump back, jiggle her hip and wiggle a bit
And get ready cuz this is about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits,
""_uck you Debbie!""
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prison is helpless,
Til someone comes along on a mission
and yells ""_itch""
A visionary, vision is scary,
could start a revolution,
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask,
In the fact that I got everyone
kissing my a--
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much
of my a-- you ask for me?
Well I'm back (*Batman Noise*)
fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter
Into the front of your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting,
the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing ""Attention Please""
Feel the tension soon as soon
someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me
A tisk-it a task-it,
I go tit for tat with anybody
who's talking this & that sh_t
Chris Kirkpatrick,
you can get your a-- kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit a ards,
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie,
You 36 year old bald headed scared ____ me
You don't know me, you're too old
Let go, it's over, nobody listens to techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I will be there with a whole list full
of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself
into a symbol
But sometimes man it just seems,
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting,
But its just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley,
To do Black Music so selflessly
And use it to get myself worthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,

I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Bitch I'm signin'
I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body
Spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (the coupe)
They trippin' on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)

I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""

When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again

And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit them with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it is just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to you
When you're bit with the—

I said knock knock, let the devil in

Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me

And dream of you and I

Just let me hold you in these arms tonight

Make it do-down, du du du

Said I didn't need to get down and feel empty inside

And told me that she love me for as long as she's alive

And well, maybe she's right, cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me

See, I honestly, don't even know why

I, I honestly don't even know why

I can be the one you blame

you don't have to be afraid
Oh yeah
I won't hold you back no
cause there ain't no more to say
And you can keep the picture
baby I'll just keep the frame
And we build sand castles
just to let them blow away

"Oh love, you know I swear I saw you in the night again
‘Cause, oh love, girl since you left I haven't drawn a single breath
Maybe it's just a daydream
'Cause I've been feeling like I'm floating above the rooms I'm in
Wake up, what a night
The perfect night to sink into the floor and die

It's no love, but close enough
It's only fun but just because your clothes are off
And oh love, I'm mostly numb
I'm lonely 'cause you know you were my only one

You should know I don't love you

Don't think that I don't know
People come and go
But now I feel I'm on the hemisphere alone
Oh love, the things you said still echo on inside my head
Maybe it's just a daydream
'Cause I've been feeling like I'm floating above the rooms I'm in
Wake up, what a night
The perfect night to sink into the floor and die

It's no love, but close enough
It's only fun but just because your clothes are off
And oh love, I'm mostly numb
I'm lonely 'cause you know you were my only one

And it's so hard and it's cold here And I'm tired of taking orders
And I miss old Rockford town Up by the Wisconsin border
What I miss, you won't believe Shoveling snow and raking leaves
And my plane will touch down On the day after tomorrow
I close my eyes every night And I dream that I can hold you
They fill us full of lies, everyone buys About what it means to be a soldier
I still don't know how I'm supposed to feel About all the blood that's been spilled
Will God on his throne get me back home On the day after tomorrow?
You can't deny, the other side Don't want to die any more than we do
What I'm trying to say is, don't they pray To the same God that we do?
Tell me how does God choose Whose prayers does he refuse?
Who turns the wheel? Who throws the dice On the day after tomorrow?
Silent night, holy night, All is calm, all is bright
I am not fighting for justice, I am not fighting for freedom
I am fighting for my life And another day in the world here
I just do what I've been told We're just the gravel on the road
And only the lucky ones come home On the day after tomorrow
And the summer, it too will fade And with it brings the winter's frost, dear
And I know we too are made Of all the things that we have lost here

Diving too deep for coins

All of your street light eyes

Wide on my plastic toys

I cut my long baby hair

Stole me a dog-eared map

And called for you everywhere

Have I found you?

Flightless bird

Jealous, weeping

Or lost you?

American mouth

Big pill looming

Now Im a fat house cat

Nursing my sore blunt tongue

Watching the warm poison rats

Curl through the wide fence cracks

Pissing on magazine photos

Those fishing lures thrown in the cold and clean

Blood of Christ mountain stream

Have I found you?

Flightless bird

Grounded, bleeding

Or lost you?

Though only in the hope that one day I would undress her

Don't be offended

You think I'm 'bout to tell you that ""I love you""

But I really really really fucking don't

See the months of obsession

And crying for hours

I even started sitting down in the shower, girl

I'll take my time on my own

And I'll be fine now I'm alone

Constantly told stories with a stretch of the truth

Trying hard to make memories to remember from youth

Desperately wanting you to be interested too

It's not clear what I need yet

But it's clear it's not you

Here's what I'd say to any young man that's still interested in you

Do you prioritize the things in your life

The things that you hope to do

Cause if not then

Mate you'd better trust me when I tell you that

It's not worth forgetting about yourself

Because of one fucking girl

She may seem perfect, and gorgeous, and lovely

You'll think she likes you

I mean I thought she loved me, no

But no

The only one she loves is herself",Kodak Black,Super Gremlin
"Well I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July

You swore and said, we are not
We are not shining stars
This I know, I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives

But I'd like to think I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know when I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

Woah
My head is on fire but my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door, hold the phone, show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

I knew that I found a home for my heart beats fast 
Colors and promises 
How to be brave 
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall 
But watching you stand alone 
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow 

One step closer 

I have died everyday waiting for you 
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you 
For a thousand years 
I'll love you for a thousand more 

Time stands still 
Beauty in all she is 
I will be brave 
I will not let anything take away 
What's standing in front of me 
Every breath 
Every hour has come to this 

One step closer 

I have died everyday waiting for you 
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you 
For a thousand years

"Could you be wrong about the night
While dreaming of the day 
I stopped to take in what was mine
So terrified by nothing 
Waving my hand out in to the road
Making your plans, oh I never know 
Could you be wrong about the light 
While trying to make your way 
I hold your hand and you hold mine 
So terrified by nothing 
Waving my hand out in to the road
Making your plans oh I never know
Oh so terrified I've felt it all before
I already know 
I'm running for my life I've let it in so long
It's taking its toll 
Holding on to time oh everything must go 
I already know
All with sacrifice I let them move on ",Blxst,Chosen (Feat. Ty Dolla $ign)
"Picture this you and me in the morning
kissing over the coffee you're pouring
It could be like that every day, hate it that I wish you were
Hoping that I'm a better replacement
for the guys that you're always out chasing
or should I accept things I can't change, hate it that I wish you were
I wish you were gay so you could just hold me
Call me your babe instead of your homie
Don't know what to say, but I wish you were gay
I wish you were gay so it would be easy
For me to say that I'm catching feelings
And I know you're straight, but I wish you were gay
Now I see you get off of the subway
haven't seen you in months but it's ok
I'd forgotten but I feel the same, hate that I still wish you were
You walk up and i'm dreading the small talk
with your boyfriend he's chatting my ear off
So I lie and I say I can't stay, hate it I still wish you were
I wish you were gay so you could just hold me
Call me your babe instead of your homie
Don't know what to say, but I wish you were gay
I wish you were gay so it would be easy
For me to say that I'm catching feelings
And I know you're straight, but I wish you were gay
We'd be so good, give me one look
I know you don't mean it when you come to flirt
the dreams that I'm having are just getting worse
I wish you were gay so you could just hold me
Call me your babe instead of your homie
Don't know what to say, but I wish you were gay
I wish you were gay so it would be easy
For me to say that I'm catching feelings
And I know you're straight, but I wish you were gay

Maybe it's time
I got it off my chest

It would've
never worked out
I was just afraid to say it

But too many times
I end up in my
What ifs
I feel like stone
At the bottom of the ocean

Helen
I'm sorry I couldn't hold
My own worthless soul
For you

I don't know
Why I froze up every time
No one fed me any lines
To use

Too many times

I get it

What ifs

"You were young the day we met
Even younger than you look with that smile
Driving past the passing signs
We drift under, tilt in the wild
Stumbled on what I became
Thinking back on better days
Now I'm just waiting
Waiting on it all to end
Chasing what I'll never have again
Passing signs faded by time
Worn out words that go unspoken
Didn't understand that I would come back to see you broken
In between is all I am
I'm not time, I'm not place
Hourglass or the grace in between the sand
Now I'm just waiting
Waiting on it all to end
Chasing what I'll never have again
Now I'm just waiting
Waiting on it all to end
Am I just chasing what I'll never have again",Drake,"Way 2 Sexy (Feat. Future, Young Thug)"

I got so lucky
Oh lucky
Oh lucky
Oh lucky
Oh

You are the cream of the crop
The crack on pop
The icing on the cake
The smile on my face
You are the fish in the sea
And the needs on the bees
The flame in my fire stars in my sky
I don't know why
I got so lucky
Oh lucky

Yeah, we've had it

Burn the bridge to this world of terrifying uncertainty

These times it hurts to smile
Cry on my shoulder, I am here tonight
I know it feels like there's no end
I'll dream about your smile again
Oh, you'll feel insane
When there's no one to blame
The hamster's wheel rolls on
Like every other day
Come and lay in bed
We'll watch some friends and I can scratch your head
Just try to get some sleep my dear

"One of these days I am going to move along
Three years of this is far too long
I can’t count on you at all
And everybody said, nobody could break the bond
Till somebody came along and proved ’em wrong
So I made a fucking song that you’ll never hear
I miss you and I wish that I didn’t
When I told you that I loved you I was kidding
That last bit was a lie, yeah, I admit it
I loved you from the beginning
And I hate how quickly you forgot me
I hate that my new date’s your copy
And when you’re drunk, you’re not thinking of me
It’s great that you’re happy, it’s great that you’re flourishing
Swear that I’m done, no, wait, just one other thing
Did you ever love me or was I just another fling?
It’s fucked up that I still care and it’s fucked up that you never did
Did I wash you outta my hair? Nuh-uh, it’s a negative
When I see you my heart needs a sedative
So I’m singing all the things that I never said
One of these days I am going to move along
Three years of this is far too long
I can’t count on you at all
And everybody said, nobody could break the bond
Till somebody came along and proved ’em wrong
So I made a fucking song that you’ll never hear
There was no point in all of those phone calls
Can’t believe I had you on my ringer
Counting the times you were honest
I don’t need a hand, just a middle finger
I still see you when my eyes close
But I gotta stop looking back
All of my heart wishes I could say bye
So any last words? Nah, fuck that
One of these days I am going to move along
Three years of this is far too long
I can’t count on you at all

"I have a memory
Of a time and place where history resigned
Now my apology
All the light came in to fulminate my mind
Reach out, reach out
To all the ones who came before you
Ponder what is right
You and I, in defiance
Speak out, speak out
The conversation may afford you
Wisdom of the wise
You and I, in defiance
And I come from conscience where there is no conjugation
I would rather be a flower than the ocean
And I held myself as something of an innovation
I would rather be devoured than be broken
All my life I tried so hard
To separate myself from all
That is and was and will be torn apart
You were running unafraid
I know you, but I've changed my way
You know I take it all to heart
Home is where you've called my name
I've gone as far as the eye can blame
You said love may have lost its way
Now my life has been erased
And what I gave, I gave for you
And for myself and for the holy name
You were running unashamed
And yours is mine and all remains
As nothing ever stays the same
Reach out, reach out
To all the ones who came before you
Reach out, reach out
To all the ones who came before you
Reach out, reach out
And all at once the pain restores you
Reach out, reach out
And all at once the pain restores you
All at once the pain restores you

Now in my reverie

 Now that you're gone she's all that I've left to hold
 
And I feel so all alone
 
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke
 
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?
 
You're never gonna smile with the way that you are
 
And I feel so all alone
 

I gave it to you I thought you might appreciate
 
The way that she dances, the painted look upon her face
 
She must of come from the sun. I wanna take her through the park
 
Where she tell me I'm all that she wants and she could even talk.

How do you cry with inanimate eyes?
 
 
You're never gonna smile with the way that you are

We used to be before we became empty

Tight I know she'll break
 
Just take some glue to stay

And a tiny Christmas Island bird
She'd fallen down her wing was hurt
And the most gracious feline
She was the dearest friend a girl could have

Don't wanna fall in love again
Just wanna stay

"Far away there is a star
Raining through the night sky like a drop
Give 'em all a piece of moon for me
Somehow I can make it rain
Diamonds in the night sky, I'm like a child
And now I'm all beaten up and weak

I wanna lie here but I get knocked down
I'm only shaking cuz I'm lying in the hold
I want to shade it but I can't break free
Anyway

Somewhere out there look at my...
It's like I'm raining in the night sky like a drop 
Now you're all beaten up, you're weak

Somewhere they can make it rain
Diamonds in the night sky, I'm like a child
All alone, beaten up, free

I want to love you but I get knocked down
I want to love you when I'm lying in the ground
I want to show you but I can't break free
To be the one that I should dare to be

I want to love you but I get knocked down
I want to shake you 'cuz I'm lying in the hold
I want to shake it but I can't break free

"FEELING SO CONFUSED
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
AFRAID SHE MIGHT NOT LOVE YOU ANYMORE
AND THOUGH SHE SAYS SHE DOES
AND HASN'T LOST YOUR TRUST
WHO COULD THAT BE KNOCKING
AT HER DOOR?
MUST BE ANOTHER ONE
MUST BE ANOTHER ONE SHE LOVES
THE FEELING NEVER STOPS
NEITHER DOES THE CLOCK
WISHING FOR TOMORROW, TODAY
SHE STILL SAYS SHE'S TRUE
SO YOU START COMING TO

COMES TO STAY
MUST BE ANOTHER ONE
MUST BE ANOTHER ONE SHE LOVES",Travis Scott,ESCAPE PLAN
"So if you're lonely
You know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot away from you 
And if you leave here
You leave me broken, shattered, I lie
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot, then we can die 

I know I won't be leaving here with you 

I say don't you know
You say you don't know
I say... take me out! 

I say you don't show
Don't move, tide is low 
I say... take me out! 

I say you don't know
You say you don't know
I say... take me out!

"Meet me outside
In the dark
Where there's nothing but air
Hold me til dusk
With your lust
So I never feel fear
Cover me up
With the words
That you have prepared.
I wanna feel love
Just love
Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares
You know the saying love makes you blind
Well it robbed all my senses
It robbed my whole mind.
And I am left with no fire
And more than twice I've been fooled
And overthinking seemed rude
So you laid down your thoughts
And I helped tie the knots
And I am left with no fire
Lead me astray
carry me
For I wish to be held
Talk to me now
Lie about
What it is that you want
Smile in that way
Like that game
You always made up
Even children they know
There's no way I could be loved
Nor that I am to love
You know the saying love makes you blind
Well it robbed all my senses
It robbed my whole mind
And I am left with no fire
And more than twice I've been fooled
And overthinking seemed rude
So you laid down your thoughts
And I helped tie the knots
And I am left with no fire
And there'll be an ending point where
You might not win
It's not that I don't like you
I just love him
I'll tell myself repeatedly
It's just because he needed me then
And moving on seems seldom to be found
In corners of my mind
You know the saying love makes you blind
It robbed all my senses
It robbed my whole mind",Pop Smoke,What You Know Bout Love
"I saw you in my dreams again
And I don't even know when it will end
I don't know how you find me
when I'm hiding out
I guess I can't escape you now
It's not love, I'm with another now
I've moved on, but still I wonder how
You keep finding me when I sleep
Will you ever just release me?
Ba ba ba ba ba
I guess I can't erase you now
Ba ba ba ba ba
Always follow me around
See that smiling face, that's my baby
See that smiling face, that's my baby
But now it's been a couple weeks
I can't get no sleep,
because you're all I see, yeah
Wake up and feel like a cheat
I know I didn't and I know
I can't control my dreams but
It's draining me emotionally
I love my baby
but I lеt it get the best of mе
I go to sleep and wake,
then I give the rest of me
But there's nothing left,
she take it all from me
I can't love you both, babe, it's too much
Yeah I don't want you both, so I picked one
No I'm not into group love,
already made my mind up
I left you in the past, should be long gone
She like Freddy Krueger lurkin'
in the dream world
Maybe I'll be dead by daylight
when I see her
Just call me Claudette Morel
But no flashlight could
save me from my hell
See that smiling face, that's my baby
See that smiling face, that's my baby
See that smiling face, that's my baby
See that smiling face, that's my baby","The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar",Pray For Me
"You, you still have all the answers
and you, you still have them too
and we, we live half in the day time
and we, we live half at night

Watch things on VCRs, 
with me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars, 
you say you think we are the best thing

And you, you just know, you just do

When i find myself by the sea, 
in another's company by the sea
When I go out the pier, 
gonna dive and have no fear
Because you, you just know, you just do

Watch things on VCRs, 
with me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars, 
you say you think we are the best thing

And you, you just know, you just do

"You feel you have nothing to hide
It's dazzling like a star
Yet there is something inside
Beautiful and dangerous like a rose
Something telling you, you
Shouldn't get too close
Don't try, because
You may burn your wings and crash to the ground
It makes you wish you were lost and never found
But you feel your face is blushing now
Looking back, it's always the same vicious circle
You fall in love like you'd fall from a bicycle
And everybody's walking in slow motion
You don't, you can't control your reaction
You should try, because
You may burn your wings and crash to the ground
It makes you wish you were lost and never found
But you feel your face is blushing now
Your eyes are like an open book
One can tell everything from the way you look
The way you look
You may burn your wings and crash to the ground
It makes you wish you were lost and never found
But you feel your face is blushing now
Cause your eyes are like an open book
One can tell everything from the way you look
You're an open book","Baby Keem, Kendrick Lamar",family ties
"Hear you calling far off in the distance
And your cries are sweet enough, crash
And all the drunk people cheering all hours
Five minutes I missed when I was fifteen
Trying to figure out the meaning of it all

How can I mean it's what I wanted
How can I mean it's God in me
I need something Holier than this

For crying out loud
I don't need an answer
I just needed to say it out loud
I won't stay here
I don't need your saving
You're the kind of thing I used to sing about
You're the kind of thing I used to sing about

Here I find myself thinking
What if you are exiled
For my presumably sinful way of living
When I really am the freest of thеm all

How could you say it's what you wanted?
How could you say it's the devil in mе?
Well, I need something Holier than religion

For crying out loud
I don't need your answers
I just needed to say it out loud
I won't stay here
I don't need your saving
You're the kind of thing I used to sing about
You're the kind of thing I used to sing about
You're the kind of thing I used to sing about

How everything centres around your faith

But it doesn't and it won't and I'm great
But it doesn't and it won't and I'm great

My life will pass me by if I don't

And love is the prize

And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated

[Pre-Chorus: Simon Aldred]
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

[Chorus: Simon Aldred]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

[Verse 2: Simon Aldred]
We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If theres love in this life we're unstoppable
No we can't be defeated

[Chorus: Simon Aldred]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around","Cardi B, Bad Bunny, J Balvin",I Like It

See my confidence is shaking
And my heart is feeling vacant

You're worth saving darling
But I don't know
why you're shooting in the dark

But love pray for me

So I don't know how to love
Pray for me
I know I need somebody
So I can learn how to love

I know it's been a while
Cause my memory's on trial
For the way I used to be
My head is running miles
Round in circles and I try
To find the little light in me

You say
I can fix the broken in your heart
You're worth saving darling
But I don't know
why you're shooting in the dark

"How could you ever leave me without a chance to try
How can I be sorry if I don't know the crime

But I haven't even got this far
All I know is that my mind is in the backseat of your corvette car
You got me at my baddest
And you got me round fingertip
Should be fed up with your bullshit
But everything about you no I can't resist

How could you ever leave me without a chance to try
How can I be sorry if I don't know the crime

I hear your voice in conversations every word you spoke
Nearly blocked you on my phone about a thousand times

"Hey, once upon a younger year
 When all our shadows disappeared
 The animals inside came out to play
 Hey, when face to face with all our fears
 Learned our lessons through the tears
 Made memories we knew would never fade

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let it slip away
 He took me in his arms, I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.
 My father told me when I was just a child
 These are the nights that never die
 My father told me



 When thunder clouds start pouring down
 Light a fire they cant put out
 Carve your name into those shinning stars
 He said, Go venture far beyond these shores.
 Dont forsake this life of yours.
 Ill guide you home no matter where you are.

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let this slip away.
 When I was just a kid I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.

That turns all of this place to gold
My God, I love this shit
How could it ever get old?
We'll go to where we're inspired
And baby if we get tired
We'll just start locking our faces
Until we've wasted the day and
Then we can sleep in the highest
Tree on this mountain we're climbing
We'll take a trip to the past
Some way we're making this last
We never fall behind
Wasting all each other's time
I want to give you mine

take this in a shot right now

'Cause when I leave 
for the night, I ain't coming back

Trying on all our clothes, clothes

Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pulling up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, 
but I'm already here
And now, the dudes are lining up 
cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick em to the curb unless 
they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

Now, now, we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else

Far away from the wreck we made

Praying to God that I feel the same
I'm right here, baby, so please

Hold me up, tie me down
'Cuz I never want to leave your side
Swear to never let you down
It's been eating me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up
And tie me, tie me
Down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me
Down, down
And tie me, tie me
Down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me
Down, down

So wrap your arms around my chest
And I'll put my hands around your neck
'Cus nobody wins these waiting games
You push and you pull, but you should stay
Stay

Hold me up, tie me down
'Cuz I never want to leave your side
Swear to never let you down
It's been eating me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up

"So tired of adrenaline
Fake love on the internet
Why do I always come back again?
Every time I'm feeling low
Why do I self-medicate?
Drunk texts that I can't take back
Yeah, my heart's seen better days
But I call back anyway
I don't know how to fall for somebody else
I wanna be what you need
I've got all my emotions stuck on the shelf
It's like I'm losing a part of me
For you it's easy to hurt my stupid feelings
But when you keep on leaving
Don't tell me everything is said and done
'Cause I hate it, lonely is overratеd
I'm over feeling faded
So sick of falling in and out of love
Falling in and out of lovе
Falling in and out of love
I wish I could let you know
Every time that I wanna go out
Always end up staying home
Because I got you on my mind
And I wish I could change it
Getting used to the wasted nights
Yeah, my heart's seen better days
But you broke it anyway
I don't know how to fall for somebody else
I wanna be what you need
I've got all my emotions stuck on the shelf
It's like I'm losing a part of me
For you it's easy to hurt my stupid feelings
But when you keep on leaving
Don't tell me everything is said and done

"She Was More Like A Beauty Queen From A Movie Scene
I Said Don't Mind, But What Do You Mean I Am The One
Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round
She Said I Am The One
Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round

She Told Me Her Name Was Billie Jean,
As She Caused A Scene
Then Every Head Turned With Eyes
That Dreamed Of Being The One
Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round

People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do
And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts
And Mother Always Told Me Be Careful Of Who You Love
And Be Careful Of What You Do
'Cause The Lie Becomes The Truth

Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One
But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son

For Forty Days And Forty Nights
The Law Was On Her Side
But Who Can Stand When She's In Demand
Her Schemes And Plans
'Cause We Danced On The Floor In The Round
So Take My Strong Advice,
Just Remember To Always Think Twice
(Do Think Twice)

She Told My Baby We'd Danced 'Till Three 
Then She Looked At Me
Then Showed A Photo My Baby Cried
His Eyes Looked Like Mine
Go On Dance On The Floor In The Round, Baby

People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do
And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts
She Came And Stood Right By Me
Then The Smell Of Sweet Perfume
This Happened Much Too Soon
She Called Me To Her Room

"Oooh, oooh
Ooh
Someday, we'll be a million miles away
Waking up on Monday morning
Wishing it was Saturday
Kids screaming out, no warning
This will be a distant memory
I can hear the future calling, let it wait
'Cause you know that we got time to get ourselves together
We got time for us
So baby, let's waste our time like we'll be young forever
Stay forever young
When we were 17, feels like just yesterday
Living a lucid dream, those years just fall away
One day we'll be 33 before we're old and gray
Let's still be 17 like yesterday
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together, let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Always, you'll always be my fantasy
Even when we're grown up, know that I love you better than today
One day we'll be dancing slowly, but for now I'll make it rain
I can see the future calling, let it wait
'Cause you know that we got time to get ourselves together
We got time for us
So baby, let's waste our time like we'll be young forever
Stay forever young
When we were 17, feels like just yesterday
Living a lucid dream, those years just fall away
One day we'll be 33 before we're old and gray

"Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be?
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold?
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear

And says that

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear

And says that

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Oh,whisper three words
And I'll come runnin' and I'll
And girl, you know
That I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone",The xx,Intro
"I just want you to fit my life
But the pieces are complicated
We been doing it wrong
We just need some compromising


Do you see, darling?
Are you listening?
I'm still trying
Maybe I could make you change your ways


Say we kick back
We relapse
Moving too fast, let's recap
Not focused on facts it's a cap
Moving too, fast let's recap
Say we kick back

Moving too fast, let's recap
Not focused on facts it's a cap
Moving too, fast let's recap


It's your life, it's your world
I don't mean to interfere
It's your life, it's amazing
But I want you to fit in mine, mine


I need a recap
Came through for the night cap
In the S class, and you can't see through the glass
I keep the tint on
To protect the mood
Let me play a song
I need to see you move
You a bad lil thang with a attitude
But this patek on my wrist might change yourview
Reservation, she like Nobu
I can shut the building down
And make a table for two
The way I put it on can't be taboo
I know it's been so long I been waiting on you
Been through this before
Feelings can't ignore
I know what's in store
I need more décor
I thought love and war was impossible
Ain't nothin' stopping you
Ain't nothin' stopping you


Do you see, darling?
Are you listening?
I'm still trying
Maybe I could make you change your ways


Say we kick back
We relapse
Moving too fast, let's recap
Not focused on facts it's a cap
Moving too, fast let's recap
Say we kick back
We relapse
Moving too fast, let's recap
Not focused on facts it's a cap

And you used to swing my way, knock my door, come out to play
You'd tell me everything I'm always listening
To the stories that we made while we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's gеtting louder and the drinks are gеtting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober

I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

I think my shirt would suit ya
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

It happens every time that we go out
Wish that I could walk you home, instead I text you on your phone
Some drunken message that I know that I'll regret
It was simple in the days, when we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's getting louder and the drinks are getting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer

Just wrap my body in thеse sheets
And pour out the gasoline

Obsessing over aftermaths
Apocalypse and hopelessness

Is zero sum of tenderness (Tenderness)

Better conversation, with no limitation
Got no time to play it like a station, ayy

Taste the you, give a nigga déjà vu

I remember when I held you
You begged me 
with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time

If you don't trust him a little

Because like the song says, 
you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely 
engulfed in the blissful 
embrace of that little light 
you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, 
forgiven and refreshed

"Strike a pose with my kinfolk
Front page of the billboards
Suit and tie, and cigar smokes
Macallan shots 'til it burn throats
We still celebrating Super Bowl
Catalog looking legendary
Ring froze like it's February
XO, that's a mercenary
A quarter bill on an off-year
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruising on a yacht, 
we clear, yeah
Said you wanted 
your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics
And you didn't expect to fall for me 
once you got this dick
The city dark, city dangerous
Your girlfriend's tryna pair you 
with somebody more famous
But instead you ended up 
with someone so basic, faceless
Someone to take your pictures and frame it
And my new girl, she a movie star
My new girl, she a movie star
I loved her right, make her scream 
like Neve Campbell
But when I make her laugh, 
swear it cures my depressing thoughts
'Cause baby girl, she a movie star
Baby girl, she a movie star
I told myself that I'd never fall
But here we go again
Oh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again
Although this love is strong to me
Some things can change, go wrong with me
We don't know how it's gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We don't need the government i
nvolved because we like to touch
We don't need no damn religion 
telling us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road, 
spending lawyer fees up
Pen and pack gon' 
save my ass if these feelings freeze up

Can't wait to see you today 

I see you lookin at the time
all anxiously
look again and check that yes still 
half past 3

so what you doin
clean your hair
brush your teeth
and don't be nervous when you 
two finally meet
be a gentleman 

you'll be okay
and my god stop lookin at the clock I'll tell you when you gotta leave 

you lookin good
you lookin fresh

chew that 
take this 
and don't forget
Just be yourself when the clock 
says 4 and 30 

go and tell her she looks lovely!!

"Oh can I explain myself to you
Questions been lurking through my mind
Is it the lover for the time
I've given my heart my joy my soul to you
If it is real I sure can't see
Gotta start lookin' out for me
And in my, my heart won't take no more
I know you say that I don't care
Sometimes my way of life ain't fair
I feel it's sad for me you take the chance
So you are givin' me no choice
I think I must exercise my voice and say
This feeling there's no drug that can compare
You're so cold I can't see your breath I swear
And they told me not to fall in love
Wondering where it all went wrong
You were my poison all along
Late at night I lay awake in tears and pain (Tears and pain)
Askin' my heart for What went wrong (Hey)
Askin' myself What's goin' on
Oh come on we seem to see things eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Somehow I didn't feel the danger (Hey)
And now I'm sleeping with a stranger
To see all these years we flushed them down the drain (Down the drain)
Was that a love we can't promise
Now it's too late for both of us
No regrets for what we lost and what we shared
Maybe tomorrow we'll love again
But until then we'll stay as friends

"Looking back now, 
I didn't know what it was supposed to be
And it's like raising kids, man
If you weren't raised, 
they don't know how to raise, you know?
I just did the best that 
I could with them because 
they know fuckin' well I love them
But I didn't do the best 
I could — I didn't know what the fuck 
I was doing — I didn't
I will never forget watching 
my mother get 
put in a straightjacket and taken 
out of my home 
when I was only seven years old
She was diagnosed with Dementia 
praecox and put in a mental institution 
leaving my daddy alone 
with me and my little brothеr Lloyd
I later had an evil stepmothеr 
who further cemented the idea 
that I didn't need a mother
Growing up without one had long 
lasting impressions I didn't fully 
understand until much later in life
It bled into my relationships 
with family and those 
I had became romantically involved with
Whenever I got too close to a woman, 
I would cut her off
Part of that was vindictive and partially 
based on fear, 
but it was also totally subconsious

I wanna kiss u underneath the stars 
Maybe we'll go too far 
We just don't care 
We just don't care 
We just don't care 

U know I love it when you're loving me 
Sometimes it's better when it's publicly 
I'm not ashamed I don't care who sees 
Us hugging & kissing our love exibition, oh 

We rendezvous up on the fire escape 
I like to set off an alarm today 
The love emergency don't make me wait 
Just follow I'll lead u 
I urgently need you 

Let's go to the park 
I wanna kiss u underneath the stars 
Maybe we'll go too far 
We just don't care 
We just don't care 
We just don't care 

Let's make love, 
let's go somewhere they might discover us 
Let's get lost and lost 
We just don't care 
We just don't care 
We just don't care 

I see u closing down the restaurant 
Let's sneak and do it when your boss is gone 
Everybody's leaving we'll have some fun 
Or maybe it's wrong but u turnin me on, oh 
Ooh, will take a visit to your Mama's house 
Creep to the bedroom while your Mama's out 
Maybe she will hear it when we scream and shout 
But we will keep it rocking until she comes knocking 

Let's go to the park 
I wanna kiss u underneath the stars 
Maybe we'll go too far 
We just don't care 
We just don't care 
We just don't care 

Let's make love, 
let's go somewhere where they might discover us. 
Let's get lost and lost 
We just don't care 
We just don't care 
We just don't care 

If we keep up all this foolin around 
Will be the talk of the town 
I'll tell the world i'm in love anytime
Let's open up the blinds 
'Cause we really don't mind. 

Oh I don't care about the propriety 
Let's break the rules and ignore society 
Maybe our neighbor's like to spy, it's true 
So what if they watch what we do when we do 

Let's go to the park 
I wanna kiss u underneath the stars 
Maybe we'll go too far 
We just don't care 
We just don't care 
We just don't care 

Let's make love, 
let's go somewhere where they might discover us. 
Let's get lost and lost

"What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning 
Even when I lose, I'm winning 
'Cause I give you all, all of me
And you giive me all, all of you

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every move
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, I my head for you

My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning 
Even when I lose, I'm winning 
'Cause I give you all, all of me
And you giive me all, all of you

Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning 
Even when I lose, I'm winning 
'Cause I give you all, all of me
And you giive me all, all of you

I give you all, all of me
And you give me all, all of you",Gary Jules,Mad World (Feat. Michael Andrews)
"So indecisive, I hate it then like it
Show all my cards then try to hide em'
Making it hard when this should be easy
I'm falling apart so I can give you the pieces
Can't turn off my mind and think bout' somebody else
So obsessed with loving you I can't help myself
Will you be there in the morning callin' making sure i'm good
And when I hit you in the evening, feelin' way to insecure
And baby if I fall I want to land right in your bed
So you can tell me in the morning you trippin' how could you be so in your head

Feelings in my face that I can't ignore
Can't say these are things that I've faced before
Don't know what to do when I'm out with you
Love you so hard its uncomfortable
Can't turn down my mind and think bout' somebody else
So obsessed with loving you I can't help myself
Will you be there in the morning callin' making sure i'm good
And when I hit you in the evening, feelin' way to insecure

Baby if I fall I want to land right in your bed
So you can tell me in the morning you trippin' how could you be so in your head
Baby if I fall I want to land right in your bed

And disappear when you wish they'd stay

Yeah, they only get stronger with age
Old memories, they don't go away

Broken, hurtin', sufferin' from a shattered soul

Let me be there
Let me be there for your heart
Let me be there
I can be there 'til you're whole
You weren't touched by a man in so long
'Cause the last time it was way too strong
Let me be there
Let me be there for your heart
Let me love you
Let me love you like you need
And I'll make it
Make it my responsibility
I'll be there every step of the way
I'll get you back on your feet
Let me love you
Let me love you like you need
And you can kick me
Kick me to the curb

Back then, I was starry eyed
And now I'm so cynical
Baby, break me

"Ooh
Na na, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
So, I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Ooh, yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (Ah)
I said save your tears for another day (Ah)

"Oh you heard
What they say
Oh, the more things change
The more they stay the same
Ain't that a shame? (I know it's a shame)
I've been good
For some time
I'd be lying if I said that
You ain't on my mind
Been tryin' to give it some time

Feeling like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say

I can say that loving you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way
I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
Try to understand

Mornin' sun, mornin' high
Oh, I think this haze is for now my best disguise
No need to think about why
What'cha say, starry-eyed
How you love to smile
And watch the clouds reside
Just tryin' to give it some time

Feeling like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say

"I think I'm losing my mind

Trying to stay inside the lines

It's like I'm running in place

How you keep staying the same?

Baby, I, I guess I'm something different

And I'm okay with that

I can't fake no more smiles

That shit gon' drive me mad

I'm focused on the future

Don't care 'bout nothin' else

I'm better by myself

I'm better by myself

I don't need no one else

I'm better by myself

Myself

Don't wanna answer questions

Just want your company

It's all good on the surface

Show me what's underneath

I'm not concerned with drama

I left that shit in school

I'm more concerned with commas

Than keeping up with you

Keep that away from me

I put the Heisman up to bad energy

No empathy, especially when the kid off Hennessy

Fake friends to me make my mood go south like Tennessee

Make the fool come out like, ""Who is he?""

I mean, I'm trying to tell y'all

I'm better by myself

I'm better by myself

I don't need no one else

I'm better by myself

Myself

I don't know who to trust

These days everyone's shady

Fool me once, I'm on my own

There is no second time, baby

That's the shit I don't like

Please no yes, no maybes

So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I´m so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can´t I turn
 off the radio?

Gotta fix that calender I have
That´s marked July 15th
Because since there´s no more you
There´s no more anniversary
I´m so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

"I'm findin' ways to articulate

"Why I love to give you flowers on a Wednesday, 12 dozen roses at your door.

Or even light some candles when you come over for dinner, I wouldn’t mind to light a billion more.

Or how I like to wake up and see you with no make up, I’d still give you a ring the way you are. 

Or stay up on the phone late at night when you’re alone, looking out the window gazing up at stars.

Chorus: 
So if you’re wondering why I do the things that I do, honestly I don’t know what to say.

All these questions and answers, I just like to have her, every moment every single day.

Verse Two:
Why I love to hold you even in the public, you could call it lovely PDA.

I don’t care what city, you could pick out of the 50 states like California in the bay.

Or how I like to take you to church on every Sunday, holding hands together as we pray.

I dont care if people hate, I dont care what people say, cause my love for you will always be the same.

Chorus: 
So if you’re wondering why I do the things that I do, honestly I don’t know what to say.

All these questions and answers, I just like to have her, every moment every single day.

"Lately I`ve had the strangest feeling

With no very reason here to find

Yet the thought of losing you`s been hanging

around my mind

Far more frequently you`re wearing perfume

With you say `No special place to go`

But when I ask, will you be coming back soon

You don`t know, never know

Well, I`m a man of many wishes

Hope my premonition misses

But what I really feel

My eyes won`t let me hide

`Cause they always start to cry

`Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I`ve been staring in the mirror

Very slowly picking me apart

Trying to tell myself I have no reason

with your heart

Just the other night while you were sleeping

I vaguely heard you whisper someone`s name

But, when I asked you other the thoughts you`re keeping

You just said `Nothing`s changed`

Well,I`m a man of many wishes

I hope my premonition misses

what I really feel

My eyes won`t let me hide

`Cause they always start to cry

`Cause this time could mean good bye

Good bye oh~~

Well,I`m a man of many wishes

I hope my premonition misses

당신을 잃을 것 같다는 생각을 떨칠 수 없어요.

‘어디갈 특별한 이유는 없어' 라고 말하면서

""곧 돌아올 거죠?"" 라고 내가 물으면

당신은 말합니다. 모른다, 절대 모른다고.

왜냐면 이번에는 아마 당신과 이별을 해야 하니까요

최근에 난 거울 속을 들여다 보기 시작했죠

당신의 마음을 잡지 못한 것은

그대여, 당신이 잠자고 있었던 지난 날 밤에

당신이 희미하게 누군가의 이름을 부르는 것을 들었어요

그러나 내가 당신에게 어떤 생각을 하고 있는 가를 물었을 때

당신은 무심코 말했어요 ‘변한 건 없어!'

Never sleep 'cause we night-owls

"Girl you're a river
Of healing
I was certain that I wouldn't last
And you are the answer
To questions
That I didn't know my soul was asking

My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life

'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
I have been broken
And beaten
Yeah the world knows how to break you down
But when pain blurs my vision
I won't worry
Because you always turn it back around 

My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life

'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my Center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
 'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my Center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time

"You're turned in to Dawn FM
The middle of nowhere on your dial
So sit back and unpack
You may be here awhile
Now that all future plans 
have been postponed
And it's time to look back 
on the things you thought you owned
Do you remember them well?
Were you high or just stoned?
And how many grudges 
did you take to your grave?
When you weren't liked or followed, 
how did you behave?
Was it often a dissonant 
chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune 
with the song life was humming?
If pain's living on 
when your body's long gone
And your phantom regret hasn't 
let it go yet
You may not have died in the way 
that you must
All specters are haunted by their 
own lack of trust
When you're all out of time, 
there's nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering
No nations, no race
And Heaven is closer than those 
tears on your face
When the purple rain falls
We are all bathed in it's grace
Heaven's for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here 
when you're not all there yet
But you could be there 
by the end of this song
Where The Weeknd's 
so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on
And if your broken heart's heavy 
when you step on the scale
You'll be lighter than air 
when they pull back the vail
Consider the flowers, 
they don't try to look right
They just open their 
petals and turn to the light
Are you listening real close?
Heaven's not that, it's this
It's the depth of this moment
We don't reach for bliss
God knows life is chaos
But He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind
Train your soul to align
And dance 'til you find that divine boogaloo
In other words
You gotta be Heaven, to see Heaven
May peace be with you",Madonna,"4 Minutes (Feat. Justin Timberlake, Timbaland)"

And I don't talk sh* about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that sh*'s embarrassing, you were my everything
All that you did was make me f*in' sad
So don't waste thе time I don't have
Oh, don't try to make mе feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own

"Hello, it's me
안녕, 저에요.

I was wondering if after all these years
전 궁금했어요 이 모든 시간이 지나고 나도

You'd like to meet, to go over everything
절 만나서 우리의 모든걸 돌이켜 보고 싶어할지 말이에요

They say that time's supposed to heal ya
시간이 모든걸 치유해 준다고들 하지만

But I ain't done much healing
저는 그러지 못하네요.



Hello, can you hear me?
여보세요, 듣고 있어요?

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
전 우리가 예전에 꿈꾸었던 캘리포니아에 있어요,

When we were younger and free
우리가 더 젊고 자유로웠던 예전에...

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
전 잊었어요 세상이 우리 발밑에 있다고 느끼던 기분이 어땠는지를...

There's such a difference between us and a million miles
우리 사이에는 백만마일 만큼이나 거리가 있어요



Hello from the other side
전화기 너머로 들려오는 Hello

I must've called a thousand times to tell you
당신께 이말을 하려고 천번이나 전화한게 분명해요

I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
지금껏 제가 벌인 모든 것에 대하여 미안하다고

But when I call you never seem to be home
하지만, 그 때마다 당신은 집에 없었어요



Hello from the outside
전화기 너머로 들려오는 Hello

At least I can say that I've tried
적어도 제가 애썼다고 말할 수 있어요.

To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
당신께 상처 줘서 미안하다고 말하기 위해 애썼다고...

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
하지만, 상관 없어요. 더이상 당신은 상처 받지 않을 테니까.



Hello, how are you?
안녕, 잘 지내시죠?

It's so typical of me to talk about myself
늘 이런식으로 내 얘기를 하네요

I'm sorry, I hope that you're well
미안, 당신이 잘 지내시길 바래요



Did you ever make it out of that town
그 마을을 떠난 것이

Where nothing ever happened?
아무일도 일어나지 않아서 인가요?

It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time
우리 둘이 시간을 허비하고 있다는게 비밀도 아니에요

"i love you words i never say
friends make fun but i tell you everyday
anyway lately youve been getting me home safely
wake up love the coffee that you make me
ask me how my night was 
i like us
its so easy and we dont ever fight cus
you dont blow up my phone
when youre home alone assuming
that Im coin what a guy does 
trust with just the right amount of lust
even loved by my family thats a must 
and fun everything we do me and you
my song comes on n u dance n sing too
with the windows down like Gs
we dont care whose around or who sees
and everyone is jealous of my ride 
because youre sitting in the passengers side

Its the simple things you do
i just cant get enough of you
its that perfume that you wear
and the way you do your hair
that i love so much
its the simple things you say
and how in bed we play
its the way you kiss my cheek
when you think that Im asleep
i love it so much

Everyday scrubbing it lovin it
crusin freeways in our PJs c
cause thats the fun of it unless
you wear that pretty black dress o yes
catch me in a suit so i can look as good as you
but i dont owell 
with that smile that you wear so well
and the way that you cry in movies
pass you the ball and pass it back to me
beers with the guys 
aint no thing
its your eyes and the simple things
that make this work like it should
when you rock my shirt
o you look so good 
so take my hand n stay as long as you can w the man
that tells all the jokes only you understand 
and i promise to be honest if you promise to accomplish love
all we need is love",Sub Urban,Cradles
"Selfish, I gotta be selfish
Whether it's for me or for you or for us
I gotta be selfish
What we're doing's not helping no one
I'm feeling so helpless
Where did it go wrong?
Thought the love we had was strong
Can you tell me what I did wrong?

Though we're not meant to be
Know we were meant to meet
You were a blessing in disguise
We tried to make amends
But God had different plans
I see my future in your eyes
And it's not by your side
It's for the best baby
We're both going places
We need to grow

We were both just a stepping stone
Giving, getting growth
And now it's time to let each other go
I never thought the best thing I could do for you
Was to be true just to myself

Though we're not meant to be
Know we were meant to meet
You were a blessing in disguise (yeah)
We tried to make amends
But God had different plans
I see my future in your eyes
And it's not by your side
It's for the best baby
We're both going places
We need to grow

Just keep your head held high
No, forever wasn't right
But the future's still so bright
I feel it, I feel it
So keep your head held high
Make that shift inside your mind
Give yourself a little time
To feel it, to feel it

Though we're not meant to be
Know we were meant to meet
You were a blessing in disguise
We tried to make amends
But God had different plans
I see my future in your eyes
And it's not by your side

"When we're all alone and the night has falled 
And lost in what each other needs 
When the silence echoes our nervous hearts 
And all is just the way we feel 
I can't hide it, shouldn't fight it
Go with instinct  
why deny it
You are all I ever wanted   
So let's run free
And loose ourselves in love
We've never been here before 
So were gonna take our time 
Ooohh We've never been here before 
So were gonna take our time Ooooh
You shy away you was afraid   
To give into something so real 
Allow desire to rule your head 
Get lost in what we feel
You can't hide it shouldn't fight it 
Go with instinct why deny it 
You are all I ever wanted 
So let's run free 
And lose ourselves in love 
We've never been here before 
So were gonna take our time Ooohh
We've never been here before 
So were gonna take our time Ooooh",Phao,2 Phút Hơn (KAIZ Remix)
"Would it make you feel better, babe
If I told you I've been feeling things you don't believe in?
Thinking that I'm seeing things
Your heart is in the ground and my head's through the ceiling
All the possibilities
Losing my ability to know what you're feeling

I've been wondering what you think about
Baby you don't tell me so I'm only assuming
You don't think I hear you out
But say you're happy long as I'm giving the time that I'm due and
I could never leave you now
But if you feel like walking out, baby then do it

Well the rain keeps pouring down
Trouble keeps on coming 'round
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)
If you're hiding what you feel
Underneath a bitter pill
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)

I've been searching for the point of it
Moments that we share together losing their meaning
Tell me what the matter is
Feeling like you're fighting me for no fucking reason
Baby take a break from it
Space from all the petty shit should give you healing

Well the rain keeps pouring down
Trouble keeps on coming 'round
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)
If you're hiding what you feel
Underneath a bitter pill
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)

Baby I'll take it slowly
The truths of your heart unfolding
I want you to rest in knowing
(If you tell me you're over it

 We would walk on the sidewalk
 Innocent, remember?

 We were bold and young

 We need someone to lean on

 Will we walk down the same road?
 Will you be there by my side?

 Longing for you to come home

that goes both ways
When your tears roll down

I'll be there for you
But you gotta be
there for me too

"I met you in a bar in San Francisco
Said you used to have a car before the repo
Smoking Lucky cigarettes, I think the smoke went to my head
And now that summer night plays on repeat

We climbed the Golden Gate bridge just to watch the stars collide
And played that Stevie Wonder song a couple thousand times
I'm kinda scared to say it was the best night of my life
But I know I won't forget San Francisco
No, I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget that night in San Francisco
In San Francisco
In San Francisco

I met you in a bar in San Francisco
But when the sun came up we had to let go
When you took that Greyhound bus
Thought it was the end of us
But now, you're all I dream of when I sleep

We climbed the Golden Gate bridge just to watch the stars collide
And played that Stevie Wonder song a couple thousand times
I'm kinda scared to say it was the best night of my life
But I know I won't forget San Francisco
No, I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget that night in San Francisco
In San Francisco
In San Francisco

In San Fran, in San Fran, in San Francisco","R3hab, Lukas Graham",Most People (R3HAB VIP Remix)
"Remember when I told you
""No matter where I go
I'll never leave your side
You will never be alone""
Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old
Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home

I could never let you go
Couldn't run away if I tried
'Cause even when I'm all alone
You got a hold on my mind
And I'll always let you know
That I'm always gonna hold on

And I told you right from the start
You just say you the word and I'll go
No, it doesn't matter how far
'Cause your love is all that I know
Baby, you just stay where you are
And you know I won't be too long
Hold on
Hold on

Remember when I told you
""No matter where I go
I'll never leave your side
You will never be alone""
Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old
Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home

조용히 잠든 방을 열어 기억을 꺼내 들어
부서진 시간 위에서 선명히 너는 떠올라
길 잃은 마음속에 널 가둔 채 살아
그만 그만

멈춘 시간 속 잠든 너를 찾아가
아무리 막아도 결국 너의 곁인 걸
길고 긴 여행을 끝내 이젠 돌아가
너라는 집으로 지금 다시 way back home

세상을 뒤집어 찾으려 해
오직 너로 완결된 이야기를
No, I won't ever lose
As long as you're there

눈을 감으면 소리 없이 밀려와
이 마음 그 위로 넌 또 한 겹 쌓여가

To come and blind us

Believe it, I see it
I know that you can feel
No secrets worth keeping
So fool me like I'm dreaming
Take me through the night

We don't need the light

"I'm good without my baby, better without him
I was so young, I was so dumb when I gave you my heart
Think you're so mean, think you're so clean in your old classic car
But honestly looks can be deceiving you look good from afar
But when you're up close you're a loser and you lowered the bar
Oooo, finally got back everything I gave to you
Every part of me that I left in your room
Now I really don't care what you do, or who you do it with
I really don't care, I think I just quit
I was bad now I'm better
I was sad now I'm better
Looking back I knew you were no good (no good)
I'm by myself and that's better
For my health you know know you put me through hell
But whatever, I'm good (I'm good)
I'm good, I'm good
I'm good, I'm good
You fooled me once and you fooled me twice, don't try me again
You're comin' around, tryna wear me down but I won't be your friend
And I dont wanna say it out loud but I still miss you now and then
I'll cover my tracks and I'll never go back cause you're a dead-end
Oooo, finally got back everything I gave to you
Every part of me that I left in your room
Now I really don't care what you do, or who you do it with

Wanna take my clothes off, wanna touch my hips, my thighs, my hair, not yours, all mine 
Wanna dance you out of my (gotta dance you out of my) hips, my thighs, my wrongs, my rights
Listen to the rhythm and make no compromise 

Cos you hurt me 
I don't want to believe that I belong to you
I move myself in ways that you could never do
I want you more, I want you more

When my song come on
Give you chills, get you crying in the club babe
So many tears cos you try to fight the love babe 
You move your body to the synths and the drums babe
You move your body til the rise of the sun 
Just go with the motions baby 

Girl you should go with the motions
Oh unload your emotions baby
You been suppressing emotions 
Oh there's no, no escaping me
Let it out like therapy 
There's no, no escaping me

I wanna get you out of my hips, my thighs, my hair, my eyes, tonight's the night
I told the universe I'm gonna fuck your lies
Then cut all ties
And you're high as a satellite 

I want you more, I want you more
I think about us together

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]

She looks good in the morning

And she don't even know it

I don't want you to go yet

Can we stay in the moment?

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes

When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like

You look good in the morning

And you don't even know it

I knew that

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

[Verse 2: Macklemore]

Sundress with you on my arm

Take the coupe out the garage

Pull the roof back just me, you and the stars

Toast to the Gods

She's the one, a masterpiece

She a drug got a fast release

Got me sprung wrapped in sheets

Wake up, fuck, and then we going back to sleep

[Verse 3: Macklemore]

Me and you on an island

With the ocean color stuck in your iris

We're comfortable in silence

But I prefer when we wilding

Sundress, nothing underneath as we undress

You could look in my eyes see I'm some mess

Couple of broken people

Trying to complete each other

Under one breath

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes

When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like

You look good in the morning

And you don't even know it

I knew that

I just wanna be part of your symphony

"Open water
Just what you wanted
So don’t leave me drowning
Don’t let me down

Don’t
Don’t hold it back like that, just pull me closer
Baby
Let’s make the most of this before it’s over
Over

Time
Don’t wanna waste the feel
Like we could make it real
Don’t run away when you could be lovin’ me
Signs, too busy reading minds
Already made it here
Don’t overthink when you could be lovin’ me

(When you could be lovin’ me)
(When you could be)

Get me started
Before this started
I could be giving someone all of me
Totally
Totally

Don’t
Don’t hold it back like that, just pull me closer

So better make the most of this before it’s over
Over

Don’t wanna waste the feel

Don’t run away when you could be lovin’ me

Already made it here
Don’t overthink when you could be lovin’ me

Play it safe case I don’t feel the same

Under my skin, under my skin
Got me struggling to know where you end and where I begin
And we feel incredible, we feel no pain
You got me feeling insane
Got me struggling to know where you end and where I begin

Had my head under water
Had my mind under covers
Had my faith in the gutter
Under water, water, water, water, water

But when you look at me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Eyes on me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Noting matters at all 
When I see you with your
Eyes on me 
I'm higher, higher, higher

Higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher 

Imma pop out wid it, no lie
Imma get it wet oh baby, we slide
Head in the clouds when I look in your eyes 
I don't got a doubt in the back of my mind
That you got it, got it, got it all (got it, got it, got it all)
And you know it's you that drives me crazy (know it's you that drives me crazy)

Had my head under water
Had my mind under covers
Had my faith in the gutter
Under water, water, water, water, water 

But when you look at me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Eyes on me
I'm higher, higher, higher
Noting matters at all

"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the ""Get Well Soon"" cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But, mom, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces. It's tearing me up but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""
Hallelujah, you're home
I fluffed the pillows
made the beds
stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive
then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

"I see those tears in your eyes

Oh love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Cold hands red eyes
Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks

Just forget about this mess
Been waiting on the sidelines

And I feel so helpless inside

If your ghost pulls you up high
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

And you whisper I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don't talk
And if they could they'd say

Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

If your ghost pulls you up high
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
My love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired",Bruno Mars,Marry You

you're holding me tonight

Do we need somebody

We're stranger things, dream of places at

Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out?
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember
We left the light that's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love
Like I'm picturing now
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountain to the foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I see a technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

We look for stranger things

I know you will be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea

Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got
If I had a diamond heart
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
Cause every station is playing our song

And you don't even know me

Take some time off
And let's get back to the basics
And know this
Our love will grow post hypnosis
Oh and I'm still dazed
From watching you too closely
I can't think straight
Cause every single morning
I wake up next to nothing and got nowhere to be
Just a couple small chores and a few groceries
And I dance all day picture you in my mind
I'd like to go back in time
And leave my number behind
I miss the sunshine
Not the heat on the beach
But the way that your eyes, shined on me
I miss the starlight
It wasn't for long
And I'd hoped you'd be here
But you're gone now
Because it's hopeless
I'm at work and I can't focus
And you don't even know this
And you don't even know me
And you didn't even notice
When I held your hand and pulled you on the stage
You put me in hypnosis
You got me in hypnosis baby
I loved the last song
Cause I know it's your favorite
It won't last long
Cause you're always changing
Take some time off
And let's get back to the basics
And know this
Our love will grow post hypnosis",H.E.R.,Best Part (Feat. Daniel Caesar)
"Ummm, yea
Mirrors they never lie
Don't see myself inside
Why can't I get it right?
I don't know
You're always watching me fall
Shadows they like my wall
Why do I feel so small?
I don't know

So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know

I've lost, I've lost
I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
Ooh

Tired of being afraid
But lately, I've lost my faith
What is love without pain, it ain't home
You're watching me but I'm below
When I get caught I hope
This is kinda like how they will
Take me home

So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know

I've lost, I've lost
I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again

I know that I'm a mess
But I ain't trying to be the best
Oh, whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay
Never said I was an angel
I am damaged all the way
So whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay

I've lost, I've lost
I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again",UMI,Love Affair

(feat. Dan Caplen, Jess Glynne & Macklemore)


 [Macklemore:]
 I know you moved onto someone new
 Hope life is beautiful
 You were the light for me to find my truth
 I just wanna say, thank you

[Dan Caplen:]
 Leaving to find my soul
 Told her I had to go
 And I know it ain't pretty
 When our hearts get broke
 Too young to feel this old
 Watching us both turn cold
 Oh, I know it ain't pretty
 When two hearts get broke
 Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
 When two hearts get broke

[Jess Glynne:]
 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days
 These days
 These days, these days
 These days, these days

[Dan Caplen & Jess Glynne:]
 Three years of ups and downs
 Nothing to show for it now
 And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
 Calling me when I'm drunk
 Remind me of what I've done
 And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

 Oh I know, I know
 Oh I know, I know
 Oh I know, I know
 These days, these days
 Oh I know, I know
 Oh I know, I know
 Oh I know, I know
 To these days, these days

[Macklemore:]
 Cigarettes in the ashtray
 Reminiscing on those past days
 I thought you'd end up with my last name
 But that changed
 And I traveled around the world
 Think where you living at now?
 I heard you moved to Austin
 Got an apartment and settled down
 And every once in a while
 I start texting
 Write a paragraph
 But then I delete the message
 Think 'bout you like a past time
 I could cry you a river
 Get you baptised or
 I wasn't ready to act right
 Used to always think I'd get you back, right
 They say that things fall apart
 We were gonna move to Brooklyn
 You were gonna study Art
 Love is just a tool
 To remind us who we are
 And that we are not alone
 And we're walking in the dark

[Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen:]
 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
 We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

Uh, loves all of you, like I'm John Legend or somethin'
Better save some room, for my heart, it's a big one
I'ma give it to you, ain't no better mood than you
Really helped me find my groove
Fake hoes come in by the pool
Real ones, there's barely a few
But, somehow I found you
Harmony when I'm around you
Paradise when I'm around you (I'm around you)
These feelings brand new (Feelings brand new)
Lean when you fall, need your, need your love
A million miles, you would walk for me
All four oceans, you would cross for me
Stop sippin' purple potion (For you, babe)
For you (Babe), keep it true, babe (This fire)
If I ever try to leave, you'll be stalkin' me
Won't let any other woman come and talk to me
I'd do the same thing if you leave, honestly
Or I would take your life away

"I wandered to LA
Wandered to LA
True story
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Maybe it's the love, maybe it's the drugs
Maybe it's because my girlfriend is the plug
Cocaine strums like guitar chords
She loves drugs, she goes hardcore
She's hidin' from the truth, it's under the rug
Maybe it's because the lies, they fill her up
You see the ghost on her front porch
You see the blood at her front door
We were doin' Xans in a Honda Accord
Lookin' at the things that we couldn't afford
Fantasies became reality, but only for one of us
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Pillowtalkin' 'bout our future and our dreams
Speakin' 'bout how life ain't really as it seems
Reminiscin' 'bout the days you broke my heart
Thankful that we worked it out, we come so far
Say you gotta give me space and let me breathe
Say you gotta give me lovin', that I need
Still we gotta focus on the little things
Never wanna end up how we used to be
And I don't wanna hear you say-ayy
That you don't want to be me with me
Especially when I need some company
That's why I need you to come for me
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor

"No girl can tell me about my mother
16 shots, we last longer than a ladder
None of them want to talk about their crime boss
Put the bodies in a pot, they will burn like grabba*
No boy can diss me or my mother
It isn't safe around here, everyone needs armour
16 shots, we are going to kill any brother
Rah-ta, rah-ta
Ka-kah, ka-kah, ka-kah

You couldn't be tougher than a Kingston?
Disrespect my mother, and your skin will start to bleed
So, don't bother, don't mess with my mommy
With my mommy, with my mommy
Baby, think you're tough, say you're tougher than she
If a dog barks, it's been a long time since he's eaten
Rap (music) on, pop (music) off, makes you move like a freak
They say that they are gangsters, but so is mommy

Disrespect my mother and your lips won't move
So, don't bother, don't mess with my mommy
With my mommy, with my mommy
You really think that you are tough, say you're tougher than me
If trouble starts tonight, you won't sleep
Pop on, cut off, makes you look like a creep
They say they want a bad girl, but there are none
 
They are going to put their hands on a girl
They are going to put their hands on her

Take one shot, if you think they are men
Take two shots, if you feel they are a gangster
Take three shots, if you think they are idiots
Take four shots if you are a couple
Take five shots, if anyone thinks they are tough

 right next to Deniro, but I'll be hood forever
 I'm the new Sinatra, and... since I made it here
 I can make it anywhere, yea, they love me everywhere
 I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicano's
 right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's
 Took it to my stashbox, 560 State St.
 catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons with them Pastry's
 Cruisin' down 8th St., off white Lexus
 drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
 Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
 now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
 Say what's up to Ty-Ty, still sippin' mai tai's
 sittin' courtside, Knicks & Nets give me high five
 Nigga I be Spike'd out, I could trip a referee
 Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from....

 Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
 Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
 You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
 but I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
 Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
 Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
 Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
 for foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act

 Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
 so they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
 lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
 then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple eve
 Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
 Anna Wintour gets cold, in Vogue with your skin out
 City of sin, it's a pity on the wind
 Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
 Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
 Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
 Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
 And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
 Came here for school, graduated to the high life
 Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
 MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
 The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

You're not even speaking to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were looking forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget

He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it’s gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain

I keep on looking back on better days

You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything (oh wow)

I swear to you I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life

"Man, we could be superstars
We been ridin', wreckin' cars (ayy bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stakes for us
Kickin' off power mirrors
Yeah, we could be superstars
But I'm pretty sure time is up
And so we fell in love with spinnin' drops
Still only a child, but faithful error (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)

Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer
Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like fuck this glitter
Skeet off dirt, I'm ditchin

Whatever you with, I'm with it
How you gon' cross a nigga that rockin' with you
I got you lit in the city
I been multitaskin', rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children
I been standin' on business
And spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy
I do all the smackin', he ain't never step or help

Caught him pants down, nigga you shitted
I knew the Perc was fake, but I still ate it
Cause I'm a gremlin
Yeah, cutthroat business, KTV, backdoor wide open
Wait 'til my sniper get live, all you niggas gon' die
Time rollin', bustin' on my opponent
No half-steppin', I'm crunchin' my opps totally
We was just broke with no motion
Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches
I done went cages to stages to cages
Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby

When they gon' want me dead when I'm off probation

Now you front row for the spotlight

Young nigga on bullshit,
and I ball on 'em, Bill Cartwright
Knew I could shine through the darkness
I guess I always been a star type
That lion in me made my heart fight
Coulda been a victim of a opp pipe
Took a million risks just to get to this
'Cause we ain't the ones that the cops like
Been so many timеs God tested me
Thеy only see the answers I got right
They commentin' all on the blogs
Tryna tell me how to live my life
And I waited so patiently
If you could take off, don't wait for me
No days off, grind faithfully
I keep thankin' God for savin' me

I know that top spot, it was made for me
It all paid off,

Why would you leave me here by myself?

You don't see the strength, the resilience
How I rack my brain, but it feels as if
I'm tryin' to explain it to children
So a lot of this pain isn't healin'
No escapin' it, this anger is spillin'
Almost like recreatin' the feelin'
Of 911 when the second plane
hit the buildin'
So let 'em paint me the villain
Some of this just may be a symptom
Of havin' way too much income
But when you struggled
every day just to get some
Now all of this hate is a syndrome
When they can't relate and that stems from
Money lookin' like it grows on trees
Yeah, they're green, but those aren't leaves
Sufficed to say, with every sacrifice I made
It's like I gave up my life to fame
All the nights that I lied awake
Nights I stayed up to write and prayed
Had to claw, scratch, and fight my way
Just follow me and I'll light the way
Look to the hook if your sky look grey
And rappers, how can we be
On the same level now
when I gotta look down and see these
Clowns that are on the ground?
Bitch, I got clouds beneath me
Ever since I put out the EP
to the height of 2003-me
You ain't see the struggle to make it
out The D.
Because I made it somehow look easy
Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive
Had to lose it all to win the fight
I had to fall so many times (Oh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the last one standin' (Oh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the last one standin'",Lucky Daye,Candy Drip

"I spent the whole day in my head

Do a little spring cleanin'

I'm always too busy dreamin'

Well maybe I should wake up instead

A lot of things I regret

But I just say I forget

Why can't it just be easy?

Why does everybody need me to stay?

Oh I hate the feeling

When you're high but

You're underneath the ceiling

Got the cards in my hand I hate dealing Yeah

Get everything I need then I'm gone

But it ain't stealing

Can I get a break?

I wish that I could just

Get out my goddamn way

What is there to say?

There ain't a better time than today

But maybe I'll lay down for a little yeah

Instead of always trying

To figure everything out

And all I do is say sorry

Half the time I don't even

Know what I'm saying it about

Good news good news good news

That's all they wanna hear

No they don't like you when I'm down

But when I'm flying oh

It make 'em so uncomfortable

So different what's the difference?

Well it ain't that bad

It could always be worse

I'm running out of gas

Hardly anything left

Hope I make it home from work

Well so tired of being so tired

Why I gotta build something beautiful just

To go set it on fire?

I'm no liar but

Sometimes the truth don't

Sound like the truth

Maybe 'cause it ain't

I just love the way it sound when I say it

Yeah it's what I do

If you know me it ain't anything new

Wake up to the moon

Haven't seen the sun in a while

But I heard that the sky's still blue Yeah

I heard they don't talk about

Me too much no more

And that's a problem with a closed door

Good news good news good news

That's all they wanna hear

No they don't like you when I'm down

But when I'm flying oh

It make 'em so uncomfortable

So different what's the difference?

There's a whole lot more for

Me waiting on the other side

I'm always wondering if

It feel like summer

I know maybe I'm too late

I could make it there some other time

I'll finally discover

That there's a whole lot

More for me waiting

That there's a whole lot

More for me waiting

I know maybe I'm too late

I could make it there some other time

Then I'll finally discover

That it ain't that bad ain't so bad

When it ain't that bad mm

"[Adam Levine:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te.
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

[Travie McCoy:]
Gym class heroes baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

[Travie McCoy:]
Let's go!
If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

[Bridge:]
I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

[Chorus:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te

And punching my liver

Choke me, I can't breathe, what's reality?

Uh-huh, numb the pain with my wealth
Uh, a bag from Chanel match the double C on my belt, uh

Woke up to your cry, girl, I'm fine

So let me just revel and bask,
In the fact that I got everyone

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much

Well I'm back (*Batman Noise*)
fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter
Into the front of your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting,

Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

Now lets go, just give me the signal
I will be there with a whole list full

I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself
into a symbol
But sometimes man it just seems,
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting,
But its just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley,
To do Black Music so selflessly
And use it to get myself worthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works

But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

"[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—


[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Malevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', ""L-L-L-Let us in!""
L-L-Like like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of the motel then
Dr. Dre said ""hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit them with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—


[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I’m
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

(W-W-When they get bit with the—)


[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it is just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to you
When you're bit with the—

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

I'm the big homie, but I ain't the oldest, hmm
Bitch dry hatin', tryna get noticed
Man, ain't nobody come to see you, Otis, look
How many bitches lyin' if they say they bars is better?
They really puppets, so I really gotta go and Geppetto
I'm really talkin', but it really can apply to whoever
My pen a freak, it'll go after a bitch or a nigga (Huh)
Big bank take lil' bank, bitch, add it up
Hoes takin' shots, but they ain't in my caliber
Booked, but I squeeze a lil' head in my calendar
Lookin' in the mirror like, ""Damn, I don't brag enough""
LVs, double C's, Birkins, I'm workin'
My chain ain't hittin' if a bitch ain't hurtin'
Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch
One thing I know, two things for certain
None of these hoes sayin' shit to my face
And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talkin' all the shit that I want
And I dare one of these hoes come tell me I can't
We ain't even speakin' if the nigga ain't spendin'
He could never say that I was one of his women
I don't even let niggas know where I stay
I'll be damned if he thinkin' he poppin' up on this pimpin' (Ah)



Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit

Is that why you broke my trust?, No fuss

You know there's a place in mind
she wants to go
And it's all but decided
The road they provide is all just for show
People out on the docks
Others punch in the clocks
There's a million ways I could go
With a growing persistence
To add on the distance from
Everything that I know
Break a smile, end the silence
Rely on reliance

Making up for the distance
Decline all assistance

Tell me when it hurts 'cause I can't keep finding out

Tell me when to cry 'cause I can't keep freaking out

Just when I convinced myself I couldn't live without

Pure coincidence, it never seemed to get me down

[Chorus]

But

I'll follow in tow

I'll follow this into the darkness

I'll get what I want

I'll get it oh so suddenly, so suddenly

[Verse 2]

Tell me when the lights start shining down on all our teeth

Pull me to an open chair and I'll take a seat

The song keeps playing on when it stopped I never learned

I keep running on never knowing where to turn

[Chorus]

But

I'll never slow down

I'll follow this into the morning

"I want to know

Where I can go

When you're not around

And I'm feeling down

So won't you stay for a moment

So I can say

I, I need you so

Cause right now you know, that nothing is new

And I'm obsessed with you

Then I fell to the ground

And you smile at me instead

I don't wanna see you crying

You don't have to feel this emptiness

She said I love you till the day that I die

Maybe she's right

Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me

And to be honest I don't even know why

I let myself get down in the first place

I'm trying to keep my mind at bay

Sunflowers still grows at night

Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

Make it down down, do-do-down

Make it do-down, du du du

Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream

And dream of you and I

There's no need to keep an open eye

I promise I'm the one for you

Just let me hold you in these arms tonight

I'm lucky to be near you

You can see it in my face

But when I fucked my shit up too many times

Why would I let myself get down in the first place

I'm trying to keep my mind at bay

Sunflowers still grows at night

Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

Make it down down, do-do-down

Make it do-down, du du du

Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry

Said I didn't need to get down and feel empty inside

And told me that she love me for as long as she's alive

And well, maybe she's right, cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me

See, I honestly, don't even know why

I, I honestly don't even know why

I'm trying to keep my mind at bay

Sunflowers still grows at night

Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

Make it down down, do-do-down

Make it do-down, du du du

Oh I'm punching the wall till I ain't got no skin on my knuckles
But the crowd in the stands going off singing tough act to follow
Sunrise and
Gunfights when we fight
Come find me
Put a knife thru my heart ya
Make a noise in the silence
Maybe better if we die young
Heaven is for no one
Come find me
Right-hand drive
I don't mind don't mind
High summernights
I don't mind
In the dark of night I see ghosts and the all look like models

"Sunlight on the bed sheets 
Your eyes looking heavy 
Shit shows on the telly 
We don't mind, we don't mind at all 
Go halves on a whole piece       
Sweet taste, strawberry 
No need for us to get ready
'Cause we treat time like a waterfall
But now I'm dreading every weekend 
Nostalgia giving me the feeling
That I might never find another like you
I just need one more vanilla sundae with you
When we got nothing to do
but watch the day go by      
So tell me, did you want one more
vanilla sundae with me
Then we can call it history
If that's what you really want
Skies grey in the morning
Eyes red, tears are pouring     
Blueberry Monday is calling
So many things that I have to do
It's stormy weather
I can't forget ya 
I tried, know that I tried 
So aren't you missing all the whispers
You know you always made me shiver 
But now the summer's never felt so cold
I just need one more vanilla sundae with you  
When we got nothing to do
but watch the day go by
So tell me, did you want one more
vanilla sundae with me
Then we can call it history
If that's what you really want
Let's talk about it 
Come, let's talk about it now, girl
I can't live without it Please don't make me live without it, girl 
Don't wanna try another flavour, I want you  
'Cause I just need
I just really need one more (I need, I need)
Sweet vanilla sundae  
I just need one more vanilla sundae with you 
When we got nothing to do
but watch the day go by 
So tell me did you want one more

"Baby girl when was it that you had decided
Oh, you'd call it off and on
You were just having fun with loving one last time
Still I'd catch you when the days through at my side passing by
Wishin' someday you'd make up your mind
Oh, alone, alone again on valentine
Oh, alone, alone again on valentine
Honey bee was it your buzzin' I adored?
You've stung me twice before, I kept coming back
Kept coming back for more
Always reminded of the days when you were my
Cherry lime (My cherry lime)
Finding our own worlds getting lost, you and I (Long gone an)

"You think that you own the Earth
You think that you're really the scum of it
So how do you know your worth?
I wish I could say
We try to explain ourselves
When really, we know that there's nothing to say
It helps us control ourselves
So we talk some more
But now all I have is something I don't
And though that's bad
You have to remember that's how it goes
When the tricks of the mind don't seem like tricks at all, all

"How could I ignore you?

Trust me I adore you

We're swimming through our dreams

Kiss me in the shower

For a couple hours

Though we're only sixteen

And sit down beside me

Don't call me daddy

Cause that's just fucking weird

Promise that you'll stay here

You and I can lay here

Until the end of time

But girl, well don't you worry about me

It ain't new to me, feeling this lonely (darling)

Girl, don't worry about me

But if you're ever unhappy

Then maybe, baby, I must let you go

Let you go

Baby now it's best here, to lay me down and rest here

Let's dream of Corduroy

Work for what you love to do and I will watch right over you

With your heart I'll never toy

And you're the other half of me

Drink and sleep and laugh with me

Take me from myself

See I'm a fucking basket-case

Until I'm able to see your face

You saved me from myself

But girl, don't worry about me

Cause it ain't new to me, feeling this lonely

If you're ever, ever unhappy

Then maybe, maybe baby I must let you go",Cash Cash,Too Late (Feat. Wiz Khalifa & Lukas Graham)
"I was a quick wet boy

Diving too deep for coins

All of your street light eyes

Wide on my plastic toys

Then when the cops closed the fair

I cut my long baby hair

Stole me a dog-eared map

And called for you everywhere

Have I found you?

Flightless bird

Jealous, weeping

Or lost you?

American mouth

Big pill looming

Now Im a fat house cat

Nursing my sore blunt tongue

Watching the warm poison rats

Curl through the wide fence cracks

Pissing on magazine photos

Those fishing lures thrown in the cold and clean

Blood of Christ mountain stream

Have I found you?

Flightless bird

Grounded, bleeding

Or lost you?

American mouth

Big pill, stuck going down.",Kaytranada,Intimidated (Feat. H.E.R.)

We're gonna put your heart back together
So all those little pieces they took from you
They're coming back now
They'll miss 'em too
So close your eyes
I'll count to three

"Always felt like I needed to please her, or impress her

Though only in the hope that one day I would undress her

Don't be offended

You think I'm 'bout to tell you that ""I love you""

But I really really really fucking don't

See the months of obsession

And crying for hours

I even started sitting down in the shower, girl

I'll take my time on my own

And I'll be fine now I'm alone

Constantly told stories with a stretch of the truth

Trying hard to make memories to remember from youth

Desperately wanting you to be interested too

It's not clear what I need yet

But it's clear it's not you

Here's what I'd say to any young man that's still interested in you

Do you prioritize the things in your life

The things that you hope to do

Cause if not then

Mate you'd better trust me when I tell you that

It's not worth forgetting about yourself

Because of one fucking girl

She may seem perfect, and gorgeous, and lovely

You'll think she likes you

I mean I thought she loved me, no

But no

Neither of us will get down from the shelf

The only one she loves is herself",The Chainsmokers,Roses (Feat. Rozes)
"Well I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July

You swore and said, we are not
We are not shining stars
This I know, I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives

But I'd like to think I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know when I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

Woah
My head is on fire but my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door, hold the phone, show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

Carry on, carry on

Every hour has come to this

I have died everyday waiting for you 
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you 
For a thousand years 
I'll love you for a thousand more 

And all along I believed I would find you 
Time has brought your heart to me

While trying to make your way 
I hold your hand and you hold mine

Watch it brush against her skin

Keeping it light like silk chiffon

Don't need to worry about no one
She said I got her if I want
She's so soft like silk chiffon

"One of these days I am going to move along
Three years of this is far too long
I can’t count on you at all
And everybody said, nobody could break the bond
Till somebody came along and proved ’em wrong
So I made a fucking song that you’ll never hear
I miss you and I wish that I didn’t
When I told you that I loved you I was kidding
That last bit was a lie, yeah, I admit it
I loved you from the beginning
And I hate how quickly you forgot me
I hate that my new date’s your copy
And when you’re drunk, you’re not thinking of me
It’s great that you’re happy, it’s great that you’re flourishing
Swear that I’m done, no, wait, just one other thing
Did you ever love me or was I just another fling?
It’s fucked up that I still care and it’s fucked up that you never did
Did I wash you outta my hair? Nuh-uh, it’s a negative
When I see you my heart needs a sedative
So I’m singing all the things that I never said
One of these days I am going to move along
Three years of this is far too long
I can’t count on you at all
And everybody said, nobody could break the bond
Till somebody came along and proved ’em wrong
So I made a fucking song that you’ll never hear
There was no point in all of those phone calls
Can’t believe I had you on my ringer
Counting the times you were honest
I don’t need a hand, just a middle finger
I still see you when my eyes close
But I gotta stop looking back
All of my heart wishes I could say bye
So any last words? Nah, fuck that
One of these days I am going to move along

"I have a memory
Of a time and place where history resigned
Now my apology
All the light came in to fulminate my mind
Reach out, reach out
To all the ones who came before you
Ponder what is right
You and I, in defiance
Speak out, speak out
The conversation may afford you
Wisdom of the wise
You and I, in defiance
And I come from conscience where there is no conjugation
I would rather be a flower than the ocean
And I held myself as something of an innovation
I would rather be devoured than be broken
All my life I tried so hard
To separate myself from all
That is and was and will be torn apart
You were running unafraid
I know you, but I've changed my way
You know I take it all to heart
Home is where you've called my name
I've gone as far as the eye can blame
You said love may have lost its way
Now my life has been erased
And what I gave, I gave for you
And for myself and for the holy name
You were running unashamed
And yours is mine and all remains
As nothing ever stays the same
Reach out, reach out
To all the ones who came before you
Reach out, reach out
To all the ones who came before you
Reach out, reach out
And all at once the pain restores you
Reach out, reach out
And all at once the pain restores you
All at once the pain restores you

Now in my reverie

 She sounds like the songs you used to sing to put me to sleep but
 Now that you're gone she's all that I've left to hold
 
And I feel so all alone
 
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke
 
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?
 
You're never gonna smile with the way that you are
 
And I feel so all alone
 

I gave it to you I thought you might appreciate
 
The way that she dances, the painted look upon her face
 
She must of come from the sun. I wanna take her through the park
 
Where she tell me I'm all that she wants and she could even talk.
 

I feel so all alone
 
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke
 
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?
 
 
You're never gonna smile with the way that you are

The way she carries the things that remind me of who
 
We used to be before we became empty
 

She's a lot like you 
But when i hold her too 
Tight I know she'll break
 
Just take some glue to stay

"For once there is nothing up my sleeve
Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me
I used to run at first sight of the sun
Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up

The city outside still sounds like it's on fire
You put on new sheets, the white flag of a Saturday night
I know we stayed up talking in circles
But I like to think the symmetry will keep me close to you

For everyone, I'm out to prove wrong, you keep the light on
The only one, you know me better than the truth
So, despite what I've done, I pray to God that we can move on
Cause thus far you are the best thing that this life has yet to lose

And for once there is nothing up my sleeve
Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me

Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up
I lay here waiting for you to wake up

So if you gonna leave, if you gonna go
I can't bare to sleep without you in my arms
I know we got caught up sifting through a crowd of pebbles and lures
But you must not let them take you
They don't know you like I do

For once there is nothing up my sleeve
Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me
I used to run at first sight of the sun
Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up
I lay here waiting for you to wake up

Do you remember when we stayed up till the sun strikes through the room
I used to blame it on the Queen's Walk in down 7th avenue

Be real, you'll beat me at bingo

I wanna be the one that makes your day

The one you think about as you lie awake

But won't you wait

You know it's too late

Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great

I feel great...

You need to be yourself

Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool that makes your heart melt

Who knows what you truly felt

You're still my favourite girl

You better trust me when I tell you there ain't no one else more beautiful in this damn world

Can you walk on the water if I,

Or keep your eyes on the road 
and live in the familiar without you and I

of gold to true life

It's a danger
Every shade of us you fade down to keep
them in the dark on who we are
This love is gonna be the death of me
It's a danger
Cause our love is a ghost
that the others cant see

We took a walk to the summit at night, 
you and I
To burn a hole in the old grip 
of the familiar true to life
And the dark was opening wide, do or die
Under a mask of vermillion ruling eyes

You make me high, high, higher than the skyline

It's so unreal it's true
I don't know what to do
I'm badly hooked on you
She's like a drug She makes me high
Her kind should come with a label or a warning sign
Highly addictive, deadly seductive
Cuz in the end you're gonna pay forever & a day, you better keep away,
But you do it you do it anyway
You make me high, high, higher than the skyline
Can't deny, the signs, this feeling I can't hide

I don't know how to describe the way you make me feel
It's so unreal it's true
I don't know what to do
Call me a loser, call me a user, this drug ain't giving no hangover
I'll be your follower not just on twitter
I'll be the slave, you be the leader
You make me high, high, higher than the skyline
Can't deny, the signs, this feeling I can't hide
It's in your eyes, your smile

"one night to be confused
one night to speed up truth
we had a promise made

four hands and then away both under influense
we had devine scent to know what to say
mind is a razorblade

to call for hands of above to lean on
wouldn't be good enough for me, no

one night of magic rush
the start a simple touch
one night to push and scream and then releaf
ten days of perfect tunes
the colors red and blue

we had a promise made we were in love
to call for hands of above to lean on
wouldn't be good enough for me, no

to call for hands of above to lean on
wouldn't be good enough

and you, you knew the hands of the devil
and you, kept us awake with wolf teeths
sharing different heartbeats in one night

to call for hands of above to lean on
wouldn't be good enough for me, no

to call for hands of above to lean on
wouldn't be good enough for me, no",Arizona Zervas,ROXANNE
"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus:]
Don't say ""Yes"", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""

Fun gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride to be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me
Don't you?

[Chorus:]
Don't say ""Yes"", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""

Don't say ""Yes"", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, ""Speak now""

Ooh, la la la
Ooh (Don't say a single vow) ooh

I hear the preacher say, ""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Chorus:]
Don't say ""Yes"", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""

And you'll say ""Let's run away now,
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door""
Baby, I didn't say my vow
So glad you were around
When they said, ""Speak now""","24KGoldn, Justin Bieber, J Balvin, iann dior",Mood (Remix)

"I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost Upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again
On that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother's telling stories
about you on a tee ball team
You taught me about your past
thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again
In the middle of the night
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

Hey, you call me up again
just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days
and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf
from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost
the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well",Sampa The Great,Energy (Feat. Nadeem Din-Gabisi)

I said ""Somewhere you never been to""

So we walked back to that beach bar
She said ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?""
So we drank bottom shelf
She said ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said ""Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home""
And she said ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""

It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do'

I wear T-shirts

Been here all along so why can't you see

"Starry, starry night Paint your palette blue and gray

별빛 찬란하게 빛나는 밤 당신 팔레트를 파랑색과 회색으로 칠하세요

Look out on a summer's day

내 영혼의 어둠을 이해하는 눈으로

With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

여름날 밖을 내다 보세요

Shadows on the hills Sketch the trees and the daffodils

언덕 위의 그림자들 나무와 수선화를 스케치하세요

Catch the breeze and the winter chills

눈처럼 새하얀 천 바닥에

In colors on the snowy linen land Now I understand

미풍과 겨울의 한기를 색채로 표현하세요 이제는 알수있어요

What you tried to say To me

당신이 내게 하려 했던 말이 무엇이었는지

How you suffered for your sanity

맑은 정신을 가지려 얼마나 괴로워했는지

How you tried to set them free

그네들 자유케하려고 얼마나 애를 썼는지

They would not listen They did not know how

아무도 들으려 하지 않았죠 듣는 방법도 몰랐고요

Perhaps they'll listen now

이제서야 귀 기울이려 하겠지만...

Starry, starry night

별빛 찬란하게 빛나는 밤

Flaming flowers that brightly blaze Swirling clouds in violet haze

불꽃처럼 밝게 타오르는 꽃들 보랏빛 안개 속에 휘도는 구름들

Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue

빈센트의 청자빛 눈에 어리네요

Colors changing hue Morning fields of amber grain

색조를 바꾸는 물감 곡식들 누런 아침 들판

Weathered faces lined in pain

화가의 다정한 손길을 받아

Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

고통으로 지친 얼굴들이 위로를 받지요

Now I understand What you tried to say To me

이제는 알수있어요 당신이 내게 하려 했던 말이 무엇이었는지

How you suffered for your sanity

맑은 정신을 가지려 얼마나 괴로워했는지

How you tried to set them free

그네들 자유케하려고 얼마나 애를 썼는지

They would not listen They did not know how

아무도 들으려 하지 않았죠 듣는 방법도 몰랐고요

Perhaps they'll listen now For they could not love you

이제서야 귀 기울이려 하겠지만 사람들은 당신을 사랑할 수 없었죠

But still your love was true And when no hope was left inside

하지만 당신의 사랑은 진실했어요 내면에 아무 희망도 남지 않은

On that starry, starry night

별빛이 찬란하게 빛났던 그날 밤

You took your life as lovers often do

연인들이 그러듯이 당신은 목숨을 끊어 버렸죠

But I could have told you Vincent

하지만 난 당신에게 말할 수 있었어요

This world was never meant for one As beautiful as you

이 세상은 당신처럼 아름다운 이에게는 어울리지 않는 곳이라고

Starry, starry night

별빛 찬란하게 빛나는 밤

Portraits hung in empty halls Frameless heads on nameless walls

빈 방에 걸린 초상화들 이름 모를 벽에 걸린 액자 없는 얼굴들

With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

당신이 만난 낯선 이들

Like the strangers that you've met The ragged men in ragged clothes

누더기 차림의 남루한 사람들처럼 그 두 눈 세상을 바라보며 잊지 못하네요

The silver thorn of bloody rose

밟지 않은 눈 위엔 짓밟혀 뭉개진

Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow Now I think I know

새빨간 장미의 은빛 가시...이제는 알것 같아요

What you tried to say To me

당신이 내게 하려 했던 말이 무엇이었는지

How you suffered for your sanity

맑은 정신 가지려 얼마나 괴로워했는지..

"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know

About love anymore 
Love is nothing 
I am yours 

You're in my body 
In my house I can 
Drag you toward 
My generous heartland 

But I'm spilling out
Around you I need 
Your help I cant last 
All in a frenzy 

I have nothing to say 
about love anymore 
Love is nothing 
I am yours 

Braced for kindness
Slack insensitive 
Woman I'm being 
A little abrasive 

Guess I don't need to run 
away with this love
I don't need to protect 
I should be afraid of this love 

I know Its my fault 
I need to lie dead 
To find a cascade toward
Something but dread 

I have nothing to say 
about love anymore 
Love is nothing 
I am yours

I have nothing to say 
about love anymore 
Love is nothing 
I am yours","Juice WRLD, Justin Bieber",Wandered To LA

And now's our moment.
Take it in feel it all and hold it.
Eyes on you, eyes on me.
We're doing this right.

Cause lovers dance when they're feeling in love.
Spotlight shinning, it's all about us.
It's oh, oh, oh, oh, all about uh, uh, uh, uh, us.
And every heart in the room will melt,
This is a feeling I've never felt but,
It's oh, oh, all about us.

Suddenly, I'm feeling brave.

Why I feel this way.

"Mistakes we're gonna make 'em
Chances gonna take 'em
Walls try and break 'em down
Time we're gonna steal it
Love like a drug gonna deal it
Like a high I wanna feel it, now
I've been talking to the stars
Been reaching through the dark
And holding out my heart
Do you ever lay awake at night, staring up at a lonely sky
Wondering if it's gonna drop on you, like a rock on you
Yeah I do too
Do you ever wanna run away, get scared you'll lose your faith
Like it's all gonna stop on you, walk out on you
Yeah I do too
We all got more questions than answers, dreams too big to lose
Sometimes you worry too much
Yeah I do too
Everybody's got beautiful, we all got scars
Why hide behind the filter, you're a perfect work of art
What on earth are we here for
What happens next
For all the things I think I know
There's so much I don't get
Do you ever lay awake at night, staring up at a lonely sky
Wondering if it's gonna drop on you, like a rock on you
Yeah I do too
Do you ever wanna run away, get scared you'll lose your faith
Like it's all gonna stop on you, walk out on you
Yeah I do too
We all got more questions than answers, dreams too big to lose
Sometimes you worry too much
Yeah I do too
I've been up all night just steady shouting at the ceiling
Staring down my demons, need something to believe in
I've been up all night just steady shouting at the ceiling
Staring down my demons, need something to believe in

"She sat on the cliff of the bed
Tackled me with a plastic comb 
Pressed her fingers into my head
Start at the blond search for the bone 

She tried to tame me her nails and my knots.
 

Bathe with the sandman, dress up for what's not. 

Let me tangle, let me dry 
Want it wicked, let me rile 

Come into my cave 
blue hippo into the black 
I'm your problem child, 
you're matter of fact 

I slyly side step sorry 
Drag my heels across the street 
She tells me I'm unlettered while 
I read the backs of her knees  

Catch me in-habits 
one tight skyward eye 
Pull hats out of rabbits 
and salt out of the sky

Let me tangle, let me try 
Want it wicked let me rile 

Come into my cave 
blue hippo into the black 
I'm your problem child, 
your matter of fact 

What a thought was in whale water 
Was really running through the pipes 
To show off her flex-ability 
she made a fool of my fight 

I bit her belly, 
she bellowed like a swan 
Cured me like a petal
pressed in her open palm 

Let me tangle, let me try 
Want it wicked, let me rile 

Come into my cave

your matter of fact

"When it rain it pours but you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore, it's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of staying above, the rising water line

Well, the sky is finally opened, the rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella, but darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

If you could see what I see, you'd be blinded by the colours
Yellow, red and orange and green, and at least a million others
So tie up the bow, take off your coat and take a look around

'Cause the sky is finally opened, the rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella, oh darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

Oh, tie up the bow, take off your coat and take a look around
Everything is alright now

'Cause the sky is finally opened, the rain and wind stopped blowin'

I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
Yeah then I hope she shows up in a 2 am pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget and take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy

A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

"I went with you up to
The place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to
""Walden"" it with you
Any longer, it would have got old

Singing ""Ace of Spades"" when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed
L.A.'s all right
Sleeping in my bed again
And getting in my head
And then walk around the reservoir

You, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

One of your eyes is always half-shut
Something happened when you were a kid
I didn't know you then
And I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did

""How Soon Is Now"" in an '80s sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song will creep you out until you're dead
 

And you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

I want to live at the Holiday Inn
Where somebody else makes the bed
We'll watch TV while the lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind since Bowie died
Just checking out to hide from life

And all of our problems
I'm gonna solve 'em
With you riding shot-gun
Speeding, 'cause fuck the cops

And you, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

I buried a hatchet
It's coming up lavender
The future's unwritten
The past is a corridor
I'm at the exit looking back through the hall

I am a concrete wall",Pop Smoke,What You Know Bout Love

"Someone asked me once in an interview
What was growing up like?
Where'd you go to school?
And what would you do
if you weren't doin' this?
I'd be drivin' my first car,
an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job,
just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar,
and an old barstool
I'd have a Friday night crowd
in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor,
couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like
I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin'
through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show
in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this
I'd still be the same guy
they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams
maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do
I'd have a Friday night crowd
in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor,
couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like
I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin'

I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this
It ain't about the fame
It ain't about the fortune
It ain't about the name
It ain't about the glory
I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about

The heart drifts from hot to cold
You think it can't make up it's mind
And suddenly it's always known
Suddenly it's always known
And if I could reach the northern lights
Maybe then I'd understand it all
Sometimes I try so hard to fight
When all I want to do is fall
Into the night
Into your arms
Surrender
Delays on the district line
Looking at pictures on my phone
And I said I didn't miss you but I lied
Told myself I let you go
Told myself I let you go

Maybe then I'd understand it all
Sometimes I try so hard to fight
When all I want to do is fall

"I can think of all the times
You told me not to touch the light
I never thought that you would be the one
I couldn't really justify
How you even thought it could be right
Cause everything we cherished is gone
And in the end can you tell me if
It was worth the try, so I can decide

Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Oh you never really love someone until, you learn to forgive

Try as hard as I might
To flee the shadows of the night
It haunts me and it makes me feel blue
But how can I try to hide
When every breath and every hour
I still end up thinking of you
And in the end everything we have makes it worth the fight
So I will hold on for as long

As leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Ohh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive

I never thought that I would see the day
That I'd decide if I should leave or stay
But in the end what makes it worth the fight's
That no matter what happens we try to make it right

Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Wounds of the past will eventually heal
And all will be alright in time
'Cause all of this comes with a love that is real
I said all will be alright in time
I said all will be alright in time
I said all will be alright in time
All will be alright in time
Ohh, you never really love someone until
You learn to forgive
You learn to forgive
Learn to forgive",Post Malone,Circles

I dreamed I was your sweetie 
A sugar doll is what I wish to be
So you’d see me
I’d turn you on
 
Oh you’d be my boogie man
My sugar lamb
My Christmas cake
My cube of ice on lemongrass
 
We wouldn’t see the time would pass
 
But again This salty rain

And all those grey, grey clouds in my brain

I guess I’m just the queen of pain 
I’m just the queen of pain

Bye bye Honey pie
Bye bye boogie man

I am not your toy
So bye bye funny boy

I dreamed I was your favourite cocktail
Your Margarita Your Bloody Mary
I’d cast a spell along your trail
 
Oh you’d be my blue lagoon
My tequila sunrise
My cup of dreams under the moon

of rain has dried off the pavement

it's been spent and traded in

I breathe reminds me of then

"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

So, shame on me now (knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

So, take it easy on me now, won't ya?

You know what just gets to me every time

Saying I ain't gonna call, then I call

Now I'm in a car, driving too fast, going too far

And there I go again

Falling back in that stupid love, pulling me in like a boomerang

It's always the same damn thing

Can't get enough

Enough of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love

I hate the way I need ya when you're leaving

You do just what you like, yeah

We break up just to make up

Slide your make up off the counter

Going back and forth for hours

Baby, I ain't got the power to fight

"Said some things I ain't proud of
I wish I could take back
Never meant to make you hurt like that, no
For a while it was perfect
You made my world standstill
Oh, and something 'bout you always will
So when it's late at night and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends or you're lonely
When you hear somebody start to say my name
Oh, when you think of me
I hope you think good things
I hope you think, think good things
I hope you think, think good things
I hope you
Picture that night in Portland
We drank three bottles of wine
I said I love you 'bout a million times
And then we drove to Seattle
And just to kiss in the rain
Now when it's pourin', do you see my face?
So when it's late at night and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends or you're lonely (You're lonely)
When you hear somebody start to say my name
Oh, when you think of me
I hope you think good things
I hope you think, think good things
I hope you think, think good things I hope you
Think of the way that I started to shake when I held you for the first time
And every kiss that our lips made feel like New Year's Eve at midnight
Think of the 3 A.M. conversations, all of the big dreams that we were chasin' down
And if I ever cross your mind somehow
When it's late at night and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends or you're lonely
When you hear somebody start to say my name
Oh, when you think of me I hope you think good things","Lo-Fi Luke, Devon Rea",Cabin In The Woods

"[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

"It's been one of them clock it in, knock it out, clock it out
'Bout to kick off the weekend
There's a stretch of blacktop, I ain't never seen a cop
So I'm pushing it a little past ten
Pulled a little money from the bank, put it in the tank
Shined up the windshield glass
Don't know where the night might lead, ain't nowhere to be
But I gotta get there fast

Or a wraparound porch with a citronella torch

Ain't ever gonna forget

"You're feeling nervous, aren't you, boy?
With your quiet voice and impeccable style
Don't ever let them steal your joy
And your gentle ways, to keep 'em from running wild
They can kick dirt in your face
Dress you down, and tell you that your place
Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine
I see you tugging on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
You get discouraged, don't you, girl?
It's your brother's world for a while longer
We gotta dance with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt in your face
To call you weak and then displace you
After carrying your baby on your back across the desert
I saw your eyes behind your hair
And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them

Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind

"We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,
See you make your way through the crowd,
And say, ""Hello.""
Little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet.""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go.""
And I said,

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.""

So, I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So, close your eyes,
Escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh.

'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter.
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet.""
But you were everything to me.
I was begging you, ""Please don't go!""
And I said,

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.

Romeo, save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.""

Oh, oh, oh.

I got tired of waiting,
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading,
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said,

""Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you, but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said,

""Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.""

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.","Damien, Sarah Barrios",How To Be An Outcast
"Every day felt like Friday
Walking to the 7-Eleven
Me and all of my best friends
We were always together
I remember talking on the phone all night
Didn't know it was a simple time
Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
If I don't, I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kind of sucks
And I'm really just missing the simple times, uh huh
I think I'm going off of the deep end
I wanna wake up on an island
Throw everybody a peace sign
Put all the static on silent
We could stay up all night
Pour one out for the simple times
Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
And if I don't, I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kind of sucks
And I'm really just missing the simple times, uh huh
There's nothing really going on
But I heard about a rager
I won't be waiting by the phone
So you can hit me on the pager
Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my high-tops on

I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay, and play that Blink-182 song

Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated

For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If theres love in this life we're unstoppable
No we can't be defeated

"Hey, once upon a younger year
 When all our shadows disappeared
 The animals inside came out to play
 Hey, when face to face with all our fears
 Learned our lessons through the tears
 Made memories we knew would never fade

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let it slip away
 He took me in his arms, I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.
 My father told me when I was just a child
 These are the nights that never die
 My father told me



 When thunder clouds start pouring down
 Light a fire they cant put out
 Carve your name into those shinning stars
 He said, Go venture far beyond these shores.
 Dont forsake this life of yours.
 Ill guide you home no matter where you are.

 One day my father—he told me,
 Son, dont let this slip away.
 When I was just a kid I heard him say,

 When you get older
 Your wild heart will live for younger days
 Think of me if ever youre afraid.

 He said, One day youll leave this world behind
 So live a life you will remember.

"I’ve been hearing symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo singing on my own
Now I can’t find the key without you

And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

And I was runnin' out of luck

Really wish he would let me in

for the night, I ain't coming back

Trying on all our clothes, clothes

Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pulling up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, 
but I'm already here
And now, the dudes are lining up 
cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick em to the curb unless 
they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

Now, now, we go until they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

"[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I want to raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go",Gabe Bondoc,Superhuman

I'm still all alone
How could this be?
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold?
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear

And says that

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear

And says that

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Oh,whisper three words
And I'll come runnin' and I'll
And girl, you know
That I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
But I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
But I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone",Franz Ferdinand,Take Me Out (FIFA ONLINE 3 TV광고 삽입음악)

"I know we've been close since we were kids
And you used to swing my way, knock my door, come out to play
You'd tell me everything I'm always listening
To the stories that we made while we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's gеtting louder and the drinks are gеtting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I'm singing hallelujah
I think my shirt would suit ya
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

It happens every time that we go out
Wish that I could walk you home, instead I text you on your phone
Some drunken message that I know that I'll regret
It was simple in the days, when we were sipping lemonade

But there's something in our soda, now we're boozing, now we're older
We get nervous every time that we get close
But the music's getting louder and the drinks are getting harder
Everybody knows the way that this thing goes

Take my hand and pull me closer
Kiss me now before I'm sober
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away
I don't wanna run away, run away, run away

"Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, 
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us 
into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own

And if you feel you're sinking, 
I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us 
into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go 
(I won't let go, no no, no no no no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope someone come 
and take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know you won't let go

I won't let go, no no, no no no no
I'll be your lifeline tonight
You won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

I won't let go
I won't let go",The Whitest Boy Alive,1517

"I heard that you're settled down
당신이 정착했다고 들었어요

That you found a girl and you're married now
한 여자를 찾아서 지금 결혼했다고...

I heard that your dreams came true
당신 꿈들이 이루어졌다고 들었어요

Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
그녀는 제가 당신께 주지 못했던 것들도 줬나 봐요



Old friend, why are you so shy?
오랜 친구여 왜 그렇게 수줍어 하나요

Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
감정을 숨기고 어둠 속에 숨는다면 당신 같지 않아요

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
제가 갑자기 불청객으로 나타나긴 싫지만
※out of the blue : 갑자기, 별안간

But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
전 멀리할 수도 없었고 그러려고 (저 자신과) 싸울 수도 없었어요

I had hoped you'd see my face
전 바랐었죠 당신이 제 얼굴을 보고

And that you'd be reminded that for me
제게 상기시켜주었으면 했어요..

It isn't over
아직 끝이 아니란 걸요...



Never mind, I'll find someone like you
괜찮아요, 당신 같은 누군가를 찾으면 돼요.

I wish nothing but the best of you too
당신이 행복하기만 바랄게요

Don't forget me, I beg
절 잊지 마세요, 제발요.

그 말이 사랑으로 남기도 하지만

But sometimes it hurts instead
이따금 상처가 되기도 해요

You know how the time flies
아시잖아요, 시간이 얼마나 빨리 흐르는지

Only yesterday was the time of our lives
우리가 살아온 시간이 어제가 다 인 것 같아요

We were born and raised in a summer haze
우린 여름 안개 속에서 태어나서 자랐어요

Bound by the surprise of our glory days
눈부신 나날들 속의 놀라움에 빠진 채로..

Obsessing over aftermaths
Apocalypse and hopelessness

Is zero sum of tenderness (Tenderness)

Make me believe there's more to live

There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones 
who loved me, baby
I look back now and realize
I remember when I held you
You begged me 
with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, 
out of time
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Gimme one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like 
I should've loved you all the time
I remember when I held you 
(Held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning 
eyes to stay (Never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you

Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time

Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, 
you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely 
engulfed in the blissful 
embrace of that little light 
you see in the distance

forgiven and refreshed

"There's a fire starting in my heart
제 맘속에 분노의 불꽃이 타오르기 시작했어요

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
활활 타오르면서, 절 어둠 속으로부터 나오게 했어요

Finally, I can see you crystal clear
이제서야 당신이란 인간이 분명히 보이네요

Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your sheet bare
계속 절 팔고 다녀봐요, 저도 당신을 다 까발릴테니까

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
어떻게 당신 모든 걸 가지고 떠나는 지 두고 봐요

Don't underestimate the things that I will do
제가 어떻게 할 지 우습게 생각하지 않는게 (좋을거에요)



There's a fire starting in my heart
제 맘속에 분노의 불꽃이 타오르기 시작했어요

Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
활활 타오르면서, 절 어둠 속으로부터 나오게 했어요

The scars of your love remind me of us
사랑의 상처들이 우리를 돌아보게 만들어요

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
그 상처들이 우리가 모든걸 가졌었다고 생각나게 하네요

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
사랑의 상처 들이 절 숨막히게 해요

I can't help feeling
제가 그렇게 느낄 수 밖에 없어요



We could have had it all
우린 전부 가질 수도 있었어요

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
(당신은 절 만나지 않았었으면 생각 할테지만요)

Rolling in the deep
깊이 빠져들면서

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
(눈물이 날거에요, 깊이 빠져들면서)



You had my heart inside of your hand
당신은 제 심장을 손에 쥐고

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
(당신은 절 만나지 않았었으면 생각 할테지만)

And you played it, to the beat
제 마음을 조종했죠, 심장박동에 맞춰서...

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
(눈물이 날거에요, 깊이 빠져들면서)



Baby, I have no story to be told
제가 당신께 들려 줄 얘기는 없지만

But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
당신에 관한 얘기를 하나 들었고, 난 당신을 화나게 할 작정이에요

Think of me in the depths of your despair
깊은 절망에 빠져 저를 생각해보세요

Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared
저 처럼 그 절망 속에서 살아봐요, 당연히 같이 할 생각은 없어요

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
(당신은 절 만나지 않았었으면 생각 할테지만요)

The scars of your love remind me of us
사랑의 상처들이 우리를 돌아보게 만들어요

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
그 상처들이 우리가 모든걸 가졌었다고 생각나게 하네요

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
사랑의 상처 들이 절 숨막히게 해요

I can't help feeling

You had my heart inside of your hand
당신은 제 심장을 손에 쥐고

Throw your soul through every open door
문이 열려 있다면 당신의 영혼을 버리세요

Count your blessings to find what you look for
당신께 주어진 축복을 헤아려봐요, 바라는 무언가를 얻는 축복을...

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
제 슬픔을 소중한 금으로 돌려놓으세요

You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

And it's like raising kids, man
If you weren't raised,

I just did the best that 
I could with them because 
they know fuckin' well I love them
But I didn't do the best 
I could — I didn't know what the fuck 
I was doing — I didn't
I will never forget watching 
my mother get 
put in a straightjacket and taken 
out of my home 
when I was only seven years old
She was diagnosed with Dementia 
praecox and put in a mental institution 
leaving my daddy alone 
with me and my little brothеr Lloyd
I later had an evil stepmothеr 
who further cemented the idea 
that I didn't need a mother
Growing up without one had long 
lasting impressions I didn't fully 
understand until much later in life
It bled into my relationships 
with family and those 
I had became romantically involved with
Whenever I got too close to a woman, 
I would cut her off
Part of that was vindictive and partially 
based on fear, 
but it was also totally subconsious

But I can’t lift this on my own
Pulling my weight in gold
Call me anxious, call me broke
But I can’t lift this on my own

I never thought I was bold enough
You pushed me further
And I take the blame for the both of us

But I can’t lift this on my own
Pulling my weight in gold

Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo(halo) halo
I can see your halo(halo) halo
I can feel your halo(halo) halo
I can see your halo(halo) halo
Woah

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest noght
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace

There´s no more anniversary

"Why I love to give you flowers on a Wednesday, 12 dozen roses at your door.

Or even light some candles when you come over for dinner, I wouldn’t mind to light a billion more.

Or how I like to wake up and see you with no make up, I’d still give you a ring the way you are. 

Or stay up on the phone late at night when you’re alone, looking out the window gazing up at stars.

Chorus: 
So if you’re wondering why I do the things that I do, honestly I don’t know what to say.

All these questions and answers, I just like to have her, every moment every single day.

Verse Two:
Why I love to hold you even in the public, you could call it lovely PDA.

I don’t care what city, you could pick out of the 50 states like California in the bay.

Or how I like to take you to church on every Sunday, holding hands together as we pray.

I dont care if people hate, I dont care what people say, cause my love for you will always be the same.

Chorus: 
So if you’re wondering why I do the things that I do, honestly I don’t know what to say.

All these questions and answers, I just like to have her, every moment every single day.

"Lately I`ve had the strangest feeling

With no very reason here to find

Yet the thought of losing you`s been hanging

around my mind

Far more frequently you`re wearing perfume

With you say `No special place to go`

But when I ask, will you be coming back soon

You don`t know, never know

Well, I`m a man of many wishes

Hope my premonition misses

But what I really feel

My eyes won`t let me hide

`Cause they always start to cry

`Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I`ve been staring in the mirror

Very slowly picking me apart

Trying to tell myself I have no reason

with your heart

Just the other night while you were sleeping

I vaguely heard you whisper someone`s name

But, when I asked you other the thoughts you`re keeping

You just said `Nothing`s changed`

Well,I`m a man of many wishes

I hope my premonition misses

what I really feel

My eyes won`t let me hide

`Cause they always start to cry

`Cause this time could mean good bye

Good bye oh~~

특별히 명백한 이유는 없지만

당신을 잃을 것 같다는 생각을 떨칠 수 없어요.

내 마음 주위로

요즘 당신은 향수를 자주 사용하는군요

‘어디갈 특별한 이유는 없어' 라고 말하면서

""곧 돌아올 거죠?"" 라고 내가 물으면

당신은 말합니다. 모른다, 절대 모른다고.

난 많은 소원을 가진 남자랍니다

나의 예감이 틀리기를 바라지만

내가 정말 느끼는 것을

나의 눈은 숨기지 못하죠

왜냐면 항상 눈물이 나오니깐

왜냐면 이번에는 아마 당신과 이별을 해야 하니까요

(오 나에게 이야기해 주세요)

최근에 난 거울 속을 들여다 보기 시작했죠

매우 천천히 나를 조각조각 내면서

나 자신에게 무슨 이유가 있다고 말하면서

당신의 마음을 잡지 못한 것은

그대여, 당신이 잠자고 있었던 지난 날 밤에

당신이 희미하게 누군가의 이름을 부르는 것을 들었어요

그러나 내가 당신에게 어떤 생각을 하고 있는 가를 물었을 때

당신은 무심코 말했어요 ‘변한 건 없어!'

나의 예감이 틀리기를 바라지만

내가 정말 느끼는 것을

나의 눈은 숨기지 못하죠

"Girl you're a river
Of healing
I was certain that I wouldn't last
And you are the answer
To questions
That I didn't know my soul was asking

Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life

'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
I have been broken
And beaten
Yeah the world knows how to break you down
But when pain blurs my vision
I won't worry
Because you always turn it back around 

My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life

'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my Center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
 'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my Center you keep me tethered

"You're turned in to Dawn FM
The middle of nowhere on your dial
So sit back and unpack
You may be here awhile
Now that all future plans 
have been postponed
And it's time to look back 
on the things you thought you owned
Do you remember them well?
Were you high or just stoned?
And how many grudges 
did you take to your grave?
When you weren't liked or followed, 
how did you behave?
Was it often a dissonant 
chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune 
with the song life was humming?
If pain's living on 
when your body's long gone
And your phantom regret hasn't 
let it go yet
You may not have died in the way 
that you must
All specters are haunted by their 
own lack of trust
When you're all out of time, 
there's nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering
No nations, no race
And Heaven is closer than those 
tears on your face
When the purple rain falls
We are all bathed in it's grace
Heaven's for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here 
when you're not all there yet
But you could be there 
by the end of this song
Where The Weeknd's 
so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on
And if your broken heart's heavy 
when you step on the scale
You'll be lighter than air 
when they pull back the vail
Consider the flowers, 
they don't try to look right
They just open their 
petals and turn to the light
Are you listening real close?
Heaven's not that, it's this
It's the depth of this moment
We don't reach for bliss
God knows life is chaos
But He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind
Train your soul to align
And dance 'til you find that divine boogaloo
In other words
You gotta be Heaven, to see Heaven
May peace be with you",Iron & Wine,Fever Dream (Album)

I wouldn't have it any other way

I'd rather be bored
Bored doing nothing with you
I'd rather be up in my bed
Watching some Netflix
Girl if there's nothing to do

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

Call 'em Nestlé, they crunchy, man
Ride 'em like a cowgirl, I'm a country fan
Ain't talkin' medicine, but I made him more a fiend
Ever since I put the cookie on quarantine
Uh, like a relay race
When I run up in this spot, bitches know they place
Slide on a nigga, I'ma need my skates
Social distance, I'ma need my space (Uh)
I done did it, I won with it
I made peace with myself, at one with it
I can't let a goofy nigga come dump in it
I told boy shoot his shot, bust guns in it (Brrr)
I mean I know that you feelin' me, I can tell that you feelin' me
Acting like you was deadin' me, boy, you really be killin' me
How you diggin' me, iggin' me, boy, you gotta be shittin' me
Is you like a comedian? You gotta be kiddin' me (Oop)

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)

Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)

All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

Something tells me it's not over 
Maybe we could run for cover now

I didn't want to be the one to say it 
I thought that maybe we could work it out

Something tells me it's not over 
Maybe we could run for cover now

Know you like a little attitude
A little spunk, a little gumption
Well baby, have a lot of gratitude
Coz I can be sweet, or poised,
or a little too feisty to function, yeah
So shut up and just hop in,
we gon' ride in style
If thrill was a sport,
I'd be the poster child
I listen to none,
but I'm all ears for you, you, you, yeah

Never told anyone anything bad

So don't waste thе time I don't have
Oh, don't try to make mе feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid

Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own

"Hello, it's me
안녕, 저에요.

I was wondering if after all these years
전 궁금했어요 이 모든 시간이 지나고 나도

You'd like to meet, to go over everything
절 만나서 우리의 모든걸 돌이켜 보고 싶어할지 말이에요

They say that time's supposed to heal ya
시간이 모든걸 치유해 준다고들 하지만

But I ain't done much healing
저는 그러지 못하네요.



Hello, can you hear me?
여보세요, 듣고 있어요?

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
전 우리가 예전에 꿈꾸었던 캘리포니아에 있어요,

When we were younger and free
우리가 더 젊고 자유로웠던 예전에...

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
전 잊었어요 세상이 우리 발밑에 있다고 느끼던 기분이 어땠는지를...

There's such a difference between us and a million miles
우리 사이에는 백만마일 만큼이나 거리가 있어요



Hello from the other side
전화기 너머로 들려오는 Hello

I must've called a thousand times to tell you
당신께 이말을 하려고 천번이나 전화한게 분명해요

I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
지금껏 제가 벌인 모든 것에 대하여 미안하다고

But when I call you never seem to be home
하지만, 그 때마다 당신은 집에 없었어요



Hello from the outside
전화기 너머로 들려오는 Hello

At least I can say that I've tried
적어도 제가 애썼다고 말할 수 있어요.

To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
당신께 상처 줘서 미안하다고 말하기 위해 애썼다고...

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
하지만, 상관 없어요. 더이상 당신은 상처 받지 않을 테니까.



Hello, how are you?
안녕, 잘 지내시죠?

It's so typical of me to talk about myself
늘 이런식으로 내 얘기를 하네요

I'm sorry, I hope that you're well
미안, 당신이 잘 지내시길 바래요



Did you ever make it out of that town
그 마을을 떠난 것이

Where nothing ever happened?
아무일도 일어나지 않아서 인가요?

It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time
우리 둘이 시간을 허비하고 있다는게 비밀도 아니에요

friends make fun but i tell you everyday
anyway lately youve been getting me home safely
wake up love the coffee that you make me
ask me how my night was

its so easy and we dont ever fight cus
you dont blow up my phone
when youre home alone assuming
that Im coin what a guy does 
trust with just the right amount of lust
even loved by my family thats a must 
and fun everything we do me and you
my song comes on n u dance n sing too
with the windows down like Gs
we dont care whose around or who sees
and everyone is jealous of my ride 
because youre sitting in the passengers side

Its the simple things you do
i just cant get enough of you
its that perfume that you wear
and the way you do your hair
that i love so much
its the simple things you say
and how in bed we play
its the way you kiss my cheek
when you think that Im asleep
i love it so much

Everyday scrubbing it lovin it
crusin freeways in our PJs c
cause thats the fun of it unless
you wear that pretty black dress o yes
catch me in a suit so i can look as good as you
but i dont owell 
with that smile that you wear so well
and the way that you cry in movies
pass you the ball and pass it back to me
beers with the guys 
aint no thing
its your eyes and the simple things
that make this work like it should
when you rock my shirt
o you look so good 
so take my hand n stay as long as you can w the man
that tells all the jokes only you understand 
and i promise to be honest if you promise to accomplish love

Can you tell me what I did wrong?

Though we're not meant to be
Know we were meant to meet
You were a blessing in disguise
We tried to make amends
But God had different plans
I see my future in your eyes
And it's not by your side
It's for the best baby
We're both going places
We need to grow

We were both just a stepping stone
Giving, getting growth
And now it's time to let each other go
I never thought the best thing I could do for you
Was to be true just to myself

And lost in what each other needs 
When the silence echoes our nervous hearts

why deny it

And loose ourselves in love

If I told you I've been feeling things you don't believe in?
Thinking that I'm seeing things

I've been wondering what you think about
Baby you don't tell me so I'm only assuming
You don't think I hear you out

Moments that we share together losing their meaning
Tell me what the matter is

Space from all the petty shit should give you healing

Give you what you deserve
I want to take you to paradise

Girl you could have anyone
So why you choosing me and not leaving me on my own
Girl you could be with anyone

"Lily was a little girl 
Afraid of the big , wide world
She grew up within her castle walls

Now and then she tried to run
And then oh the  night with the setting sun
She went in the woods away 
So afraid , all alone

They warned her , Don't go there
There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
Then something came creeping it told her

Don't you worry just follow everywhere i go 
top over the mountains of valley low 
Give you everything you ' ve been dreaming of 

Just let me in , ooh 
Everything you wanted gotta be the magic 
Story you've been told and you ' ll be safe under my control
Just let me in

Just let me in 

She knew she was  hypnotised
And walking on cold thin ice
Then it broke , and she awoke again

Then she ran faster than 
Start screming, is there someone out there ? 
Please help me , come get me 
Behind her , she can hear it say 

Follow everywhere i go 
Top over the mountains of valley low 
Give you everything you ' ve been dreaming of 
Just let me in , ooh 

Everything you wanted gotta be the magic

"I met you in a bar in San Francisco
Said you used to have a car before the repo
Smoking Lucky cigarettes, I think the smoke went to my head
And now that summer night plays on repeat

We climbed the Golden Gate bridge just to watch the stars collide
And played that Stevie Wonder song a couple thousand times
I'm kinda scared to say it was the best night of my life
But I know I won't forget San Francisco
No, I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget
I know I won't forget that night in San Francisco

But when the sun came up we had to let go
When you took that Greyhound bus
Thought it was the end of us

And played that Stevie Wonder song a couple thousand times

Think you're so mean, think you're so clean in your old classic car
But honestly looks can be deceiving you look good from afar
But when you're up close you're a loser and you lowered the bar
Oooo, finally got back everything I gave to you
Every part of me that I left in your room
Now I really don't care what you do, or who you do it with
I really don't care, I think I just quit
I was bad now I'm better
I was sad now I'm better

I'm by myself and that's better

But whatever, I'm good (I'm good)

You fooled me once and you fooled me twice, don't try me again
You're comin' around, tryna wear me down but I won't be your friend
And I dont wanna say it out loud but I still miss you now and then
I'll cover my tracks and I'll never go back cause you're a dead-end

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]

She looks good in the morning

And she don't even know it

I don't want you to go yet

Can we stay in the moment?

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes

When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like

You look good in the morning

And you don't even know it

I knew that

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

[Verse 2: Macklemore]

Sundress with you on my arm

Take the coupe out the garage

Pull the roof back just me, you and the stars

Toast to the Gods

She's the one, a masterpiece

She a drug got a fast release

Got me sprung wrapped in sheets

Wake up, fuck, and then we going back to sleep

[Verse 3: Macklemore]

Me and you on an island

With the ocean color stuck in your iris

We're comfortable in silence

But I prefer when we wilding

Sundress, nothing underneath as we undress

You could look in my eyes see I'm some mess

Couple of broken people

Trying to complete each other

Under one breath

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes

When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like

You look good in the morning

And you don't even know it

I knew that

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

I got this feeling on a summer day

Knew it when I saw her face

I just thought that she could be the one

She could be the one",Britney Spears,Toxic

"I’ve been hearing symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo singing on my own
Now I can’t find the key without you

And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

I’m sorry if it’s all too much
Every day you’re here I’m healing
And I was runnin' out of luck

And every melody is timeless

Just from the look I see in your eyes 
Cant believe that I get even higher
As I feel your touch tingle down my spine 

I know I always dive in too deep 
You got me fired up
Who knew that your love could taste so sweet 
Oh oh oh oh
You got what I want yeah you got what I need

Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand 
reasons why
But you're going, 
and you know that

All you have to do is 
stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to is 
wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay

Won't admit 
what I already know
I've never been the best 
at letting go
I don't wanna spend 
the night alone
Guess I need you, 
and I need to

Make it on my own, 
but I don't wanna grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, 
drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a 
million reasons why
But you're going, 
and you know that

All you have to do is 
stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to is 
wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay

All you have to do is stay
So stay, yeah

All you have to do is 
stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to is 
wait a second

You shout it out
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall

You shoot me down but I won't fall

Cut me down
But it's you who have further to fall

Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones

Waking up warm in your arms
and without a care

Just give me the time and the place

Cause I would go the distance for you baby
I'd travel 'round the world
if you would let me
I'll meet you where the sun it always shines
You're on my mind all the time
We are not wasting this

Cause you and I we're good together oh
You always get me feeling better
And I know you stay by my side
You make me feel much better
Cause girl we're good together

And I tell you all too much girl
But I want you to know
what you got is a natural gift
I don't wrap you all the time girl
Don't wanna be rude but I would
do you catch my drift?
Yeah

Cause I would go the distance for you baby
I'd travel 'round the world if you would let me

Cause you and I we're good together oh
You always get me feeling better
And I know you stay by my side
You make me feel much better

Oh you know I would go the distance
Just to be amongst your presence
Cause I am losing my mind

"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the ""Get Well Soon"" cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But, mom, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces. It's tearing me up but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""
Hallelujah, you're home
I fluffed the pillows
made the beds
stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive
then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""
Hallelujah, you're home
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
he said, ""Hallelujah, you're home""",Clean Bandit,Symphony (Feat. Zara Larsson)
"I, I never thought I'd be your type, ah-ah-I
On my mind, the kind of love
I can't describe, ah-ah-I
You got me runnin', oh no
Away from our history, oh no
And through the darkness, oh no
Oh, I can see you and me
When you find a love that's right
You can drive all night, drive all night, ah-ah
Do what makes you feel alive
You can drive all night, drive all night
'Cause the road's callin' over again
Ride to the morning, right to the end now
When you find a love that's right
You can drive all night, drive all night
Faith, remember how
we were back then, ah-ah-I
I can't fake emotions,
I can't comprehend, ah-ah-I
You got mе runnin', oh no
Away from our history, oh no
And through the darkness, oh no
Oh, I can see you and me, oh no (Drivе)

When you find a love that's right
You can drive all night, drive all night
You and me, history
I'm runnin' from the rest of my life
Through the darkness, I see your eyes
And realize that I, that I (Drive)

Keep talking, keep laughing
One day you'll wish you hadn't
All the people want fire, fire
Maybe it's time they meet that dragon

If you're gonna hold me down
And you're not gonna let me in
Into your castle walls
None of you can keep them

Cause if I gotta

And if I gotta

Then let's break it all down
Bye bye bye

And we burn it all down

This is where the bruises come from
This is when the game gets ugly
These blood, sweat, tears keep running
Licking my plate 'cause I'm so hungry
Keep talking, keep laughing
One day you'll see what happens
All the people want fire, fire
It's about time they meet their dragon

If you're gonna hold me down
And you're not gonna let me in

Put your money where your mouth is
Bury your doubts under the ground
And they gonna watch you step over the ashes 
Right now i'm taking my turn with the matches

Cause if I gotta

"I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Cold hands red eyes
Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
You don't know what goodbye means

Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
Been waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

If your ghost pulls you up high
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

And you whisper I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don't talk
And if they could they'd say

Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

If your ghost pulls you up high
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you

"It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights
And slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why
Wonder what for
Why we keep 
coming back for more
Is it just our bodies
Are we both losing our minds
Is the only reason 
you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely
Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright
Is the only reason 
you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely
Too much time 
losing track of us
Where was the real
Undefined 
spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights
And slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why
Wonder what for
It's like we keep 
coming back for more

Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out?

We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember
We left the light that's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things

But I'm just looking out for you tonight

Tell me someday we'll get there

Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

We look for stranger things

"Hello, sweet grief
I know you will be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea

Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got
If I had a diamond heart
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
Cause every station is playing our song
Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made of
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

"Touch me touch me touch me
You have someone that loves you

Whoever said
it was easy must have had it pretty good
Must have had it pretty good
I want you boy just to please me
Don't tell me that you could
don't tell me that you could
It's beautiful in a way with love
But what's a girl to do
when you can't seem to choose?
You're beautiful but your mind's restrained
When your mind is split two ways is
when the comedown plays

Don't touch me
Boy I want you
Not allowed to
You have someone that loves you
I'm waiting
And I'm patient
I'm deluded
You have someone that loves you

Touch me touch me
touch me touch me
You have someone that loves you

You want me close so I hear you
I thought I made it clear
don't whisper in my ear
My heart it keeps getting weaker
I know you want me near
but your love is what I fear
It's beautiful the way you move
But what's a boy to do
when he can't seem to choose?
Yeah I'm beautiful

Well, if this is fate
Then we'll find a way to cheat

And i'll guide you
With the beating of my heart

And the help don't come

To dodge a smoking gun

"I was playing on the beach with my best friends band
And it was such a bummer, yeah
The way that you left before I got a chance
To tell you that you're wavy like the water when the tide is rolling in
Those seashells in your hair l'll hear the ocean when we kiss
I think I'm crazy bout the way that you tug on your sweater
When it don't fit just right but I think that that's better
I miss the sunshine
Not the heat on the beach
But the way that your eyes, shined on me
I miss the starlight
It wasn't for long
And I'd hoped you'd be here
But you're gone now
Because it's hopeless
I'm at work and I can't focus
And you don't even know this
And you don't even know me
And you didn't even notice
When I held your hand and pulled you on the stage
You put me in hypnosis
You got me in hypnosis baby
I loved the last song
Cause I know it's your favorite
It won't last long
Cause you're always changing
Take some time off
And let's get back to the basics
And know this
Our love will grow post hypnosis
Oh and I'm still dazed
From watching you too closely
I can't think straight
Cause every single morning
I wake up next to nothing and got nowhere to be
Just a couple small chores and a few groceries
And I dance all day picture you in my mind
I'd like to go back in time
And leave my number behind
I miss the sunshine
Not the heat on the beach
But the way that your eyes, shined on me
I miss the starlight
It wasn't for long
And I'd hoped you'd be here
But you're gone now
Because it's hopeless

"Ummm, yea
Mirrors they never lie
Don't see myself inside
Why can't I get it right?
I don't know
You're always watching me fall
Shadows they like my wall
Why do I feel so small?
I don't know

So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know

I've lost, I've lost
I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
Ooh

Tired of being afraid
But lately, I've lost my faith
What is love without pain, it ain't home
You're watching me but I'm below
When I get caught I hope
This is kinda like how they will
Take me home

So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know

I've lost, I've lost
I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again

I know that I'm a mess
But I ain't trying to be the best
Oh, whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay
Never said I was an angel
I am damaged all the way
So whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay

I've lost, I've lost
I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again

We won't be dry soon
Here come the tides
You move when I do

How am I supposed to heal?
How am I supposed to fit?

 I know you moved onto someone new
 Hope life is beautiful
 You were the light for me to find my truth
 I just wanna say, thank you

[Dan Caplen:]
 Leaving to find my soul
 Told her I had to go
 And I know it ain't pretty
 When our hearts get broke
 Too young to feel this old
 Watching us both turn cold
 Oh, I know it ain't pretty
 When two hearts get broke
 Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
 When two hearts get broke

[Jess Glynne:]
 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days
 These days
 These days, these days
 These days, these days

[Dan Caplen & Jess Glynne:]
 Three years of ups and downs
 Nothing to show for it now
 And I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out
 Calling me when I'm drunk
 Remind me of what I've done
 And I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah

 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

[Macklemore:]
 Cigarettes in the ashtray
 Reminiscing on those past days
 I thought you'd end up with my last name
 But that changed
 And I traveled around the world
 Think where you living at now?
 I heard you moved to Austin
 Got an apartment and settled down
 And every once in a while
 I start texting
 Write a paragraph
 But then I delete the message
 Think 'bout you like a past time
 I could cry you a river
 Get you baptised or
 I wasn't ready to act right
 Used to always think I'd get you back, right
 They say that things fall apart
 We were gonna move to Brooklyn
 You were gonna study Art
 Love is just a tool
 To remind us who we are
 And that we are not alone
 And we're walking in the dark

[Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen:]
 I hope someday
 We'll sit down together
 And laugh with each other
 About these days, these days
 All our troubles
 We'll lay to rest
 And we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
 We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts, wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toast
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turn my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer 
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter 
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers

The same way that the rain falls
I ain't gon' lie, you got it all, all, all, all, all of me

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Uh, loves all of you, like I'm John Legend or somethin'
Better save some room, for my heart, it's a big one
I'ma give it to you, ain't no better mood than you
Really helped me find my groove
Fake hoes come in by the pool
Real ones, there's barely a few
But, somehow I found you
Harmony when I'm around you
Paradise when I'm around you (I'm around you)
These feelings brand new (Feelings brand new)
Lean when you fall, need your, need your love
A million miles, you would walk for me
All four oceans, you would cross for me
Stop sippin' purple potion (For you, babe)
For you (Babe), keep it true, babe (This fire)
If I ever try to leave, you'll be stalkin' me
Won't let any other woman come and talk to me
I'd do the same thing if you leave, honestly
Or I would take your life away

"I wandered to LA
Wandered to LA
True story
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Maybe it's the love, maybe it's the drugs
Maybe it's because my girlfriend is the plug
Cocaine strums like guitar chords
She loves drugs, she goes hardcore
She's hidin' from the truth, it's under the rug
Maybe it's because the lies, they fill her up
You see the ghost on her front porch
You see the blood at her front door
We were doin' Xans in a Honda Accord
Lookin' at the things that we couldn't afford
Fantasies became reality, but only for one of us
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Pillowtalkin' 'bout our future and our dreams
Speakin' 'bout how life ain't really as it seems
Reminiscin' 'bout the days you broke my heart
Thankful that we worked it out, we come so far
Say you gotta give me space and let me breathe
Say you gotta give me lovin', that I need
Still we gotta focus on the little things
Never wanna end up how we used to be
And I don't wanna hear you say-ayy
That you don't want to be me with me
Especially when I need some company
That's why I need you to come for me
I wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Wandered to LA hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more

You really think that you are tough, say you're tougher than me
If trouble starts tonight, you won't sleep

 There's nothin' you can't do
 Now you're in New York
 These streets will make you feel brand new
 Big lights will inspire you
 Let's hear it for New York, New York,
 New York
 
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
 Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
 Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
 You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
 but I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
 Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
 Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
 Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
 for foreigners it ain't for, they act like they forgot how to act
 8 million stories, out there in it naked
 City, it's a pity, half of y'all won't make it
 Me, I got a plug, Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
 If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
 Three dice cee-lo, three Card Monty
 Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
 Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
 Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire State that's
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
 Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
 so they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
 lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
 then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple eve
 Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
 Anna Wintour gets cold, in Vogue with your skin out
 City of sin, it's a pity on the wind
 Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
 Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
 Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
 Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
 And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
 Came here for school, graduated to the high life
 Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
 MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
 The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
 One hand in the air for the big city
 Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
 No place in the world that could compare
 Put your lighters in the air
 Everybody say ""yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah""

"You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything (oh wow)

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speaking to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were looking forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything (oh wow)

I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it’s gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything (oh wow)

I promise
I swear to you I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything (oh wow)",Kesha,Die Young

A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, What about them niggas? She say, What about them niggas?
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband

"Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive
Had to lose it all to win the fight
I had to fall so many times (Oh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the last one standin'
Uh, you weren't
with me on the cold block nights
Now you front row for the spotlight
Now the diamonds in the Audemars bright
Jets overseas for a far flight
Young nigga on bullshit,
and I ball on 'em, Bill Cartwright
Knew I could shine through the darkness
I guess I always been a star type
That lion in me made my heart fight
Coulda been a victim of a opp pipe
Took a million risks just to get to this
'Cause we ain't the ones that the cops like
Been so many timеs God tested me
Thеy only see the answers I got right
They commentin' all on the blogs
Tryna tell me how to live my life
And I waited so patiently
If you could take off, don't wait for me
No days off, grind faithfully
I keep thankin' God for savin' me
Front line, showcasin' our bravery
I know that top spot, it was made for me
It all paid off,
so we felt the struggle so painfully
Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive
Had to lose it all to win the fight
I had to fall so many times (Oh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the last one standin'
Yeah, you know the code we gotta live by
Never mind all the ice cubes on this wrist,
wearin' the big body
Live by the gun, get bodied,
or it's hella time in that cell
It was hella times where I failed
When I had to double back from them Ls
Bet he don't double back when he tell
'Cause it ain't no comin' back when you tell
Why would you leave me here by myself?
A nigga be lonely
Ayy, I blew the whole bag on they flights,
ain't leavin' the homies
If he really gang, then get him a chain,
no cubic zirconies
Why's arm in a stogie, stood firm,
never folded
Furthest thing from a rodent,
you put the jacket on and you bogus
Yeah, big dawg and they know it
I had to spin-off to stay focused
Longev' on the motion
We don't abandon ship when it's hopeless
Sound of the microphone, and they know
I make it look easy
Like I made it overnight
I make it look easy
But you don't see the dark side
And all of the monsters I had to fight (Fight)
And all of the nightmares (Nightmares)
Made me stronger than life (Yeah)
Y'all say I've changed
Really though? How so?
Got all this bread
I'm still sourdough (Sour tho')
I don't know, square peg, round hole
Like a block of cheese in a paper towel roll
Rocky Balboa, never been no towel thrower
Even when I got kicked to the curb
Life knocked my dick in the dirt
I got back up, flipped it the bird
'Til I earned the attention I yearned
Not to mention, I learned
How to turn resentment
and hurt to an unquenchable thirst
In the simplest terms,
it's revenge of the nerd
In every sense of the word
But all you see is the fame and the millions
You don't see the strength, the resilience
How I rack my brain, but it feels as if
I'm tryin' to explain it to children
So a lot of this pain isn't healin'
No escapin' it, this anger is spillin'
Almost like recreatin' the feelin'
Of 911 when the second plane
hit the buildin'
So let 'em paint me the villain
Some of this just may be a symptom
Of havin' way too much income
But when you struggled
every day just to get some
Now all of this hate is a syndrome
When they can't relate and that stems from
Money lookin' like it grows on trees
Yeah, they're green, but those aren't leaves
Sufficed to say, with every sacrifice I made
It's like I gave up my life to fame
All the nights that I lied awake
Nights I stayed up to write and prayed
Had to claw, scratch, and fight my way
Just follow me and I'll light the way
Look to the hook if your sky look grey
And rappers, how can we be
On the same level now
when I gotta look down and see these
Clowns that are on the ground?
Bitch, I got clouds beneath me
Ever since I put out the EP
to the height of 2003-me
You ain't see the struggle to make it
out The D.
Because I made it somehow look easy
Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive
Had to lose it all to win the fight
I had to fall so many times (Oh-oh-oh)

Lemme give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out, in a drought, no flow, right words, I'm pouring down
See that pain was all around, see my mode was kinda lounge
Didn't know which which-way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it
Everything that I do is electric
I'ma keep it inner motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ay

Pass the baton, back to the mall, swimming in the pool

Do a little spring cleanin'

I'm always too busy dreamin'

Well maybe I should wake up instead

A lot of things I regret

But I just say I forget

Why can't it just be easy?

Why does everybody need me to stay?

Oh I hate the feeling

When you're high but

You're underneath the ceiling

Got the cards in my hand I hate dealing Yeah

Get everything I need then I'm gone

But it ain't stealing

Can I get a break?

I wish that I could just

Get out my goddamn way

What is there to say?

There ain't a better time than today

But maybe I'll lay down for a little yeah

Instead of always trying

To figure everything out

And all I do is say sorry

Half the time I don't even

Know what I'm saying it about

Good news good news good news

That's all they wanna hear

No they don't like you when I'm down

But when I'm flying oh

It make 'em so uncomfortable

So different what's the difference?

Well it ain't that bad

It could always be worse

I'm running out of gas

Hardly anything left

Hope I make it home from work

Well so tired of being so tired

Why I gotta build something beautiful just

To go set it on fire?

I'm no liar but

Sometimes the truth don't

Sound like the truth

Maybe 'cause it ain't

I just love the way it sound when I say it

Yeah it's what I do

If you know me it ain't anything new

Wake up to the moon

Haven't seen the sun in a while

But I heard that the sky's still blue Yeah

I heard they don't talk about

Me too much no more

And that's a problem with a closed door

Good news good news good news

That's all they wanna hear

No they don't like you when I'm down

But when I'm flying oh

It make 'em so uncomfortable

So different what's the difference?

There's a whole lot more for

Me waiting on the other side

I'm always wondering if

It feel like summer

I know maybe I'm too late

I could make it there some other time

I'll finally discover

That there's a whole lot

More for me waiting

That there's a whole lot

More for me waiting

I know maybe I'm too late

I could make it there some other time

Then I'll finally discover

That it ain't that bad ain't so bad

When it ain't that bad mm

"Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla

My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisi' (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday

Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flap of my dollar stack right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Caray
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
Got 'em swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious

Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi, single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't want to hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him
Finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em
And I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me
And be on the receiving end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te.
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

[Travie McCoy:]
Gym class heroes baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

[Travie McCoy:]
Let's go!
If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

[Bridge:]
I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-oh-oh-te

"See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know you won't
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be the same young, hungry nigga from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior came with sheepskin
Still remember when I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone calling on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me to wait to beat the game, it's all in defense
And never fazed by names, that they might call me
But they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call
I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart
But I blocked off the exit, yeah
Oh-oh, I know you won't (I know you won't)
I know you won't (Oh, yeah), oh, oh, oh
I know you won't, I know that you look over us
'Til we sound aslee-ee-ee-ee-eep
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, I was up for sale
But I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go, on a new trip, here I go, actin' too lit
Here I go, actin' too rich, here I go, with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonym-est, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, ""What do you love?""
Hard to find what the truth is but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm, it was all so simple
I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know you're watching me
Eighty degrees, burning up the leaves
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water

Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back,
guess who's back, guess who's back,
guess who's back, guess who's back,

I've created a monster, cuz nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady
I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady,
then this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of me mixed
with some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jumpstart
my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked
at the hospital
By the Dr. when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table
while he's operating ""Hey""
You waited this long to stop debating
Cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart
problem is complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Yo let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on dip, bum on your lips
jump back, jiggle her hip and wiggle a bit
And get ready cuz this is about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits,
""_uck you Debbie!""
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prison is helpless,
Til someone comes along on a mission
and yells ""_itch""
A visionary, vision is scary,
could start a revolution,
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask,
In the fact that I got everyone
kissing my a--
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much
of my a-- you ask for me?
Well I'm back (*Batman Noise*)
fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter
Into the front of your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting,
the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing ""Attention Please""
Feel the tension soon as soon
someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me
A tisk-it a task-it,
I go tit for tat with anybody
who's talking this & that sh_t
Chris Kirkpatrick,
you can get your a-- kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit a ards,
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie,
You 36 year old bald headed scared ____ me
You don't know me, you're too old
Let go, it's over, nobody listens to techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I will be there with a whole list full
of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself
into a symbol
But sometimes man it just seems,
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting,
But its just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley,
To do Black Music so selflessly
And use it to get myself worthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,

I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body
Spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (the coupe)
They trippin' on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'

I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

Knock knock, let the devil in
Malevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', ""L-L-L-Let us in!""

Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of the motel then
Dr. Dre said ""hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit them with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it is just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to you
When you're bit with the—

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back

I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me

And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talkin' all the shit that I want
And I dare one of these hoes come tell me I can't

Said I didn't need to get down and feel empty inside

And told me that she love me for as long as she's alive

"Oh love, you know I swear I saw you in the night again
‘Cause, oh love, girl since you left I haven't drawn a single breath
Maybe it's just a daydream
'Cause I've been feeling like I'm floating above the rooms I'm in
Wake up, what a night
The perfect night to sink into the floor and die

It's no love, but close enough
It's only fun but just because your clothes are off
And oh love, I'm mostly numb
I'm lonely 'cause you know you were my only one

You should know I don't love you

Don't think that I don't know
People come and go
But now I feel I'm on the hemisphere alone
Oh love, the things you said still echo on inside my head
Maybe it's just a daydream
'Cause I've been feeling like I'm floating above the rooms I'm in
Wake up, what a night
The perfect night to sink into the floor and die

It's no love, but close enough
It's only fun but just because your clothes are off
And oh love, I'm mostly numb
I'm lonely 'cause you know you were my only one

And I'll come home to Illinois On the day after tomorrow
And it's so hard and it's cold here And I'm tired of taking orders
And I miss old Rockford town Up by the Wisconsin border

And my plane will touch down On the day after tomorrow
I close my eyes every night And I dream that I can hold you
They fill us full of lies, everyone buys About what it means to be a soldier
I still don't know how I'm supposed to feel About all the blood that's been spilled
Will God on his throne get me back home On the day after tomorrow?
You can't deny, the other side Don't want to die any more than we do
What I'm trying to say is, don't they pray To the same God that we do?
Tell me how does God choose Whose prayers does he refuse?
Who turns the wheel? Who throws the dice On the day after tomorrow?
Silent night, holy night, All is calm, all is bright
I am not fighting for justice, I am not fighting for freedom
I am fighting for my life And another day in the world here
I just do what I've been told We're just the gravel on the road
And only the lucky ones come home On the day after tomorrow
And the summer, it too will fade And with it brings the winter's frost, dear
And I know we too are made Of all the things that we have lost here

Though we're only sixteen

And sit down beside me

Then maybe, baby, I must let you go

Work for what you love to do and I will watch right over you

With your heart I'll never toy

And you're the other half of me

Drink and sleep and laugh with me

Take me from myself

See I'm a fucking basket-case

Until I'm able to see your face

You saved me from myself

But girl, don't worry about me

Cause it ain't new to me, feeling this lonely

Wide on my plastic toys

Jealous, weeping

Or lost you?

Now Im a fat house cat

Nursing my sore blunt tongue

Watching the warm poison rats

Curl through the wide fence cracks

Pissing on magazine photos

Those fishing lures thrown in the cold and clean

Flightless bird

Grounded, bleeding

Or lost you?

Though only in the hope that one day I would undress her

Don't be offended

You think I'm 'bout to tell you that ""I love you""

But I really really really fucking don't

See the months of obsession

And crying for hours

I even started sitting down in the shower, girl

I'll take my time on my own

And I'll be fine now I'm alone

Constantly told stories with a stretch of the truth

Trying hard to make memories to remember from youth

Desperately wanting you to be interested too

It's not clear what I need yet

But it's clear it's not you

Here's what I'd say to any young man that's still interested in you

Do you prioritize the things in your life

The things that you hope to do

Cause if not then

Mate you'd better trust me when I tell you that

It's not worth forgetting about yourself

Because of one fucking girl

She may seem perfect, and gorgeous, and lovely

You'll think she likes you

I mean I thought she loved me, no

But no

"Well I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July

You swore and said, we are not
We are not shining stars
This I know, I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives

But I'd like to think I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know when I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

Woah
My head is on fire but my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door, hold the phone, show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground

Oh so terrified I've felt it all before

"Picture this you and me in the morning
kissing over the coffee you're pouring
It could be like that every day, hate it that I wish you were
Hoping that I'm a better replacement
for the guys that you're always out chasing
or should I accept things I can't change, hate it that I wish you were
I wish you were gay so you could just hold me
Call me your babe instead of your homie
Don't know what to say, but I wish you were gay
I wish you were gay so it would be easy
For me to say that I'm catching feelings
And I know you're straight, but I wish you were gay
Now I see you get off of the subway
haven't seen you in months but it's ok
I'd forgotten but I feel the same, hate that I still wish you were
You walk up and i'm dreading the small talk
with your boyfriend he's chatting my ear off
So I lie and I say I can't stay, hate it I still wish you were
I wish you were gay so you could just hold me
Call me your babe instead of your homie
Don't know what to say, but I wish you were gay
I wish you were gay so it would be easy
For me to say that I'm catching feelings
And I know you're straight, but I wish you were gay
We'd be so good, give me one look
I know you don't mean it when you come to flirt
the dreams that I'm having are just getting worse
I wish you were gay so you could just hold me
Call me your babe instead of your homie
Don't know what to say, but I wish you were gay
I wish you were gay so it would be easy

"You were young the day we met
Even younger than you look with that smile
Driving past the passing signs
We drift under, tilt in the wild
Stumbled on what I became
Thinking back on better days
Now I'm just waiting
Waiting on it all to end
Chasing what I'll never have again
Passing signs faded by time
Worn out words that go unspoken
Didn't understand that I would come back to see you broken
In between is all I am
I'm not time, I'm not place
Hourglass or the grace in between the sand

Waiting on it all to end
Chasing what I'll never have again
Now I'm just waiting
Waiting on it all to end
Am I just chasing what I'll never have again",Khalid,Present

I got so lucky

"One of these days I am going to move along
Three years of this is far too long
I can’t count on you at all
And everybody said, nobody could break the bond
Till somebody came along and proved ’em wrong
So I made a fucking song that you’ll never hear
I miss you and I wish that I didn’t
When I told you that I loved you I was kidding
That last bit was a lie, yeah, I admit it
I loved you from the beginning
And I hate how quickly you forgot me
I hate that my new date’s your copy
And when you’re drunk, you’re not thinking of me
It’s great that you’re happy, it’s great that you’re flourishing
Swear that I’m done, no, wait, just one other thing
Did you ever love me or was I just another fling?
It’s fucked up that I still care and it’s fucked up that you never did
Did I wash you outta my hair? Nuh-uh, it’s a negative
When I see you my heart needs a sedative
So I’m singing all the things that I never said
One of these days I am going to move along
Three years of this is far too long
I can’t count on you at all
And everybody said, nobody could break the bond
Till somebody came along and proved ’em wrong
So I made a fucking song that you’ll never hear
There was no point in all of those phone calls
Can’t believe I had you on my ringer
Counting the times you were honest
I don’t need a hand, just a middle finger
I still see you when my eyes close
But I gotta stop looking back
All of my heart wishes I could say bye
So any last words? Nah, fuck that
One of these days I am going to move along
Three years of this is far too long
I can’t count on you at all

"I have a memory
Of a time and place where history resigned
Now my apology
All the light came in to fulminate my mind
Reach out, reach out
To all the ones who came before you
Ponder what is right
You and I, in defiance
Speak out, speak out
The conversation may afford you
Wisdom of the wise
You and I, in defiance
And I come from conscience where there is no conjugation
I would rather be a flower than the ocean
And I held myself as something of an innovation
I would rather be devoured than be broken
All my life I tried so hard
To separate myself from all
That is and was and will be torn apart
You were running unafraid
I know you, but I've changed my way
You know I take it all to heart
Home is where you've called my name
I've gone as far as the eye can blame
You said love may have lost its way
Now my life has been erased
And what I gave, I gave for you
And for myself and for the holy name
You were running unashamed
And yours is mine and all remains
As nothing ever stays the same
Reach out, reach out
To all the ones who came before you
Reach out, reach out
To all the ones who came before you
Reach out, reach out
And all at once the pain restores you

And all at once the pain restores you
All at once the pain restores you

And I feel so all alone

How do you cry with inanimate eyes?
 
You're never gonna smile with the way that you are
 
And I feel so all alone

She must of come from the sun. I wanna take her through the park
 
Where she tell me I'm all that she wants and she could even talk.

We used to be before we became empty

AT HER DOOR?
MUST BE ANOTHER ONE
MUST BE ANOTHER ONE SHE LOVES

"So if you're lonely
You know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot away from you 
And if you leave here
You leave me broken, shattered, I lie
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot, then we can die 

I know I won't be leaving here with you 

I say don't you know
You say you don't know
I say... take me out! 

I say you don't show
Don't move, tide is low

"Meet me outside
In the dark
Where there's nothing but air
Hold me til dusk
With your lust
So I never feel fear
Cover me up
With the words
That you have prepared.
I wanna feel love
Just love
Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares
You know the saying love makes you blind
Well it robbed all my senses
It robbed my whole mind.
And I am left with no fire
And more than twice I've been fooled
And overthinking seemed rude
So you laid down your thoughts
And I helped tie the knots
And I am left with no fire
Lead me astray
carry me
For I wish to be held
Talk to me now
Lie about
What it is that you want
Smile in that way
Like that game
You always made up
Even children they know
There's no way I could be loved
Nor that I am to love
You know the saying love makes you blind
Well it robbed all my senses
It robbed my whole mind
And I am left with no fire
And more than twice I've been fooled
And overthinking seemed rude
So you laid down your thoughts
And I helped tie the knots
And I am left with no fire
And there'll be an ending point where
You might not win
It's not that I don't like you
I just love him
I'll tell myself repeatedly
It's just because he needed me then
And moving on seems seldom to be found
In corners of my mind
You know the saying love makes you blind
It robbed all my senses
It robbed my whole mind",David Guetta,Titanium (Feat. Sia)
"I saw you in my dreams again
And I don't even know when it will end
I don't know how you find me
when I'm hiding out
I guess I can't escape you now
It's not love, I'm with another now
I've moved on, but still I wonder how
You keep finding me when I sleep
Will you ever just release me?
Ba ba ba ba ba
I guess I can't erase you now
Ba ba ba ba ba
Always follow me around
See that smiling face, that's my baby
See that smiling face, that's my baby
But now it's been a couple weeks
I can't get no sleep,
because you're all I see, yeah
Wake up and feel like a cheat
I know I didn't and I know
I can't control my dreams but
It's draining me emotionally
I love my baby
but I lеt it get the best of mе
I go to sleep and wake,
then I give the rest of me
But there's nothing left,
she take it all from me
I can't love you both, babe, it's too much
Yeah I don't want you both, so I picked one
No I'm not into group love,
already made my mind up
I left you in the past, should be long gone
She like Freddy Krueger lurkin'
in the dream world
Maybe I'll be dead by daylight
when I see her
Just call me Claudette Morel
But no flashlight could
save me from my hell

See that smiling face, that's my baby
See that smiling face, that's my baby
See that smiling face, that's my baby",Alan Walker,Sing Me to Sleep
"You, you still have all the answers

with me and talk about big love

you say you think we are the best thing

And you, you just know, you just do

When i find myself by the sea, 
in another's company by the sea
When I go out the pier, 
gonna dive and have no fear
Because you, you just know, you just do

"You feel you have nothing to hide
It's dazzling like a star
Yet there is something inside
Beautiful and dangerous like a rose
Something telling you, you
Shouldn't get too close
Don't try, because
You may burn your wings and crash to the ground
It makes you wish you were lost and never found
But you feel your face is blushing now
Looking back, it's always the same vicious circle
You fall in love like you'd fall from a bicycle
And everybody's walking in slow motion
You don't, you can't control your reaction
You should try, because
You may burn your wings and crash to the ground
It makes you wish you were lost and never found
But you feel your face is blushing now
Your eyes are like an open book
One can tell everything from the way you look
The way you look
You may burn your wings and crash to the ground
It makes you wish you were lost and never found
But you feel your face is blushing now

And your cries are sweet enough, crash

How can I mean it's what I wanted
How can I mean it's God in me
I need something Holier than this

For crying out loud
I don't need an answer
I just needed to say it out loud
I won't stay here
I don't need your saving
You're the kind of thing I used to sing about
You're the kind of thing I used to sing about

Here I find myself thinking
What if you are exiled
For my presumably sinful way of living
When I really am the freest of thеm all

How could you say it's what you wanted?
How could you say it's the devil in mе?
Well, I need something Holier than religion

Yeah, we're better in the dark so

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

Hey

Kinda like that Georgia wind
We'll be gone and back again
But always wind up right back where we are
Playin' roulette with our hearts
And blowin' smoke rings in the dark, yeah

"You say you'll be down in 5

The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs

You're fixing up your hair like you do

I know that I'll be a mess

The second that I see you

You won't be surprised

It happens every time

It's nothing new

It's always on a night like tonight

I thank God you can read my mind

Cause when you look at me with those eyes

I'm speechless

Staring at you, standing there in that dress

What it's doing to me, ain't a secret

Cause watching you is all that I can do

And I'm speechless

You already know that you're my weakness

After all this time I'm just as nervous

Every time you walk into the room

I'm speechless

It started when you said hello

Just did something to me

And I've been in a daze

Ever since the day that we meet

You take the breath out of my lungs

Can't even fight it

And all of the words out of my mouth without even trying

And I'm speechless

Staring at you, standing there in that dress

What it's doing to me, ain't a secret

Cause watching you is all that I can do

And I'm speechless

You already know that you're my weakness

After all this time I'm just as nervous

Every time you walk into the room

I'm speechless

Cause watching you is all that I can do

I'm speechless

You already know that you're my weakness

They never let poor Rudolph Join in any reindeer games

Then how the reindeer loved him, As they shouted out with glee

He was sittin' out back in a rocker
He said, What you been up to lately
I told him, Chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said, If you want my two cents on making a dollar count
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencil marks
And the grass in the yard all grow up
Cause the truth about it is
It all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt
Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around
And then he laid it out
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
And add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencil marks
And the grass in the yard all grow up
Cause the truth about it is
It all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt
You can buy dirt
And thank the good Lord for it
Cause He ain't makin' any more of it
So buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep

one night to speed up truth

the start a simple touch
one night to push and scream and then releaf

"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus:]
Don't say ""Yes"", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""

Fun gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride to be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me
Don't you?

Don't say ""Yes"", run away now

Ooh (Don't say a single vow) ooh

I hear the preacher say, ""Speak now or forever hold your peace""

Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

The air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost Upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again
On that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother's telling stories
about you on a tee ball team
You taught me about your past
thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again
In the middle of the night
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

Hey, you call me up again
just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days
and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf
from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost
the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well",Major Lazer,Jump (Feat. Busy Signal)

"Starry, starry night Paint your palette blue and gray

별빛 찬란하게 빛나는 밤 당신 팔레트를 파랑색과 회색으로 칠하세요

Look out on a summer's day

내 영혼의 어둠을 이해하는 눈으로

With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

여름날 밖을 내다 보세요

Shadows on the hills Sketch the trees and the daffodils

언덕 위의 그림자들 나무와 수선화를 스케치하세요

Catch the breeze and the winter chills

눈처럼 새하얀 천 바닥에

In colors on the snowy linen land Now I understand

미풍과 겨울의 한기를 색채로 표현하세요 이제는 알수있어요

What you tried to say To me

당신이 내게 하려 했던 말이 무엇이었는지

How you suffered for your sanity

맑은 정신을 가지려 얼마나 괴로워했는지

How you tried to set them free

그네들 자유케하려고 얼마나 애를 썼는지

They would not listen They did not know how

아무도 들으려 하지 않았죠 듣는 방법도 몰랐고요

Perhaps they'll listen now

이제서야 귀 기울이려 하겠지만...

Starry, starry night

별빛 찬란하게 빛나는 밤

Flaming flowers that brightly blaze Swirling clouds in violet haze

불꽃처럼 밝게 타오르는 꽃들 보랏빛 안개 속에 휘도는 구름들

Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue

빈센트의 청자빛 눈에 어리네요

Colors changing hue Morning fields of amber grain

색조를 바꾸는 물감 곡식들 누런 아침 들판

Weathered faces lined in pain

화가의 다정한 손길을 받아

Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

고통으로 지친 얼굴들이 위로를 받지요

Now I understand What you tried to say To me

이제는 알수있어요 당신이 내게 하려 했던 말이 무엇이었는지

How you suffered for your sanity

맑은 정신을 가지려 얼마나 괴로워했는지

How you tried to set them free

그네들 자유케하려고 얼마나 애를 썼는지

They would not listen They did not know how

아무도 들으려 하지 않았죠 듣는 방법도 몰랐고요

Perhaps they'll listen now For they could not love you

이제서야 귀 기울이려 하겠지만 사람들은 당신을 사랑할 수 없었죠

But still your love was true And when no hope was left inside

하지만 당신의 사랑은 진실했어요 내면에 아무 희망도 남지 않은

On that starry, starry night

별빛이 찬란하게 빛났던 그날 밤

You took your life as lovers often do

연인들이 그러듯이 당신은 목숨을 끊어 버렸죠

But I could have told you Vincent

하지만 난 당신에게 말할 수 있었어요

This world was never meant for one As beautiful as you

이 세상은 당신처럼 아름다운 이에게는 어울리지 않는 곳이라고

Starry, starry night

별빛 찬란하게 빛나는 밤

Portraits hung in empty halls Frameless heads on nameless walls

빈 방에 걸린 초상화들 이름 모를 벽에 걸린 액자 없는 얼굴들

With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

당신이 만난 낯선 이들

Like the strangers that you've met The ragged men in ragged clothes

누더기 차림의 남루한 사람들처럼 그 두 눈 세상을 바라보며 잊지 못하네요

The silver thorn of bloody rose

밟지 않은 눈 위엔 짓밟혀 뭉개진

Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow Now I think I know

새빨간 장미의 은빛 가시...이제는 알것 같아요

What you tried to say To me

당신이 내게 하려 했던 말이 무엇이었는지

How you suffered for your sanity

맑은 정신 가지려 얼마나 괴로워했는지..

How you tried to set them free They would not listen

그네들 자유케하려고 얼마나 애를 썼는지 아무도 들으려 하지 않았죠

They're not listening still Perhaps they never will

"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

"On a night like this
I could fall in love
I could fall in love with you
In this dark so dense
We talk so soft
The way young lovers do

The days last sight turns to cool nights breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves

I've hid myself away from this
But your silhouette is the cutest kiss

On a night like this
The moon sits still
And the stars are watching too
The way you move is a lullaby
And I could fall (I could fall) in love with you

The days last sight turns to cool nights breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves

I've hid myself away from this
But your silhouette is the cutest kiss

I could fall in love
I could fall in love with you",Kaytranada,Intimidated (Feat. H.E.R.)
"What if I cant prove 
The strength of your touch 
My cries alone 
Are not good enough 

When I am with you 
I don't feel much at all 
You asked if you were 
Working towards the fall 

I have nothing to say 
About love anymore 
Love is nothing 
I am yours 

You're in my body 
In my house I can 
Drag you toward 
My generous heartland 

But I'm spilling out
Around you I need 
Your help I cant last 
All in a frenzy 

I have nothing to say 
about love anymore 
Love is nothing 
I am yours 

Braced for kindness
Slack insensitive 
Woman I'm being 
A little abrasive 

Guess I don't need to run 
away with this love
I don't need to protect 
I should be afraid of this love 

I know Its my fault 
I need to lie dead 
To find a cascade toward
Something but dread 

I have nothing to say 
about love anymore 
Love is nothing 
I am yours

I have nothing to say 
about love anymore 
Love is nothing

Chances gonna take 'em
Walls try and break 'em down

Love like a drug gonna deal it

Been reaching through the dark
And holding out my heart

Do you ever wanna run away, get scared you'll lose your faith
Like it's all gonna stop on you, walk out on you
Yeah I do too

Sometimes you worry too much
Yeah I do too

Why hide behind the filter, you're a perfect work of art
What on earth are we here for
What happens next
For all the things I think I know
There's so much I don't get

Staring down my demons, need something to believe in

"She sat on the cliff of the bed
Tackled me with a plastic comb 
Pressed her fingers into my head
Start at the blond search for the bone 

She tried to tame me her nails and my knots.
 

Bathe with the sandman, dress up for what's not. 

Let me tangle, let me dry 
Want it wicked, let me rile 

Come into my cave 
blue hippo into the black 
I'm your problem child, 
you're matter of fact 

I slyly side step sorry 
Drag my heels across the street 
She tells me I'm unlettered while 
I read the backs of her knees  

Catch me in-habits 
one tight skyward eye 
Pull hats out of rabbits 
and salt out of the sky

Let me tangle, let me try 
Want it wicked let me rile 

Come into my cave 
blue hippo into the black 
I'm your problem child, 
your matter of fact 

What a thought was in whale water 
Was really running through the pipes 
To show off her flex-ability 
she made a fool of my fight 

I bit her belly, 
she bellowed like a swan 
Cured me like a petal
pressed in her open palm 

Let me tangle, let me try 
Want it wicked, let me rile

"I've been on the highway for two days

As long as my heart still beats

I'm just tryna lay low, so don't mind me
Struggle with my own fights so don't try (don't try)
To tell me that it's alright

"We're all in the same boat

Wondering where the same time goes 
We're all in the same boat

Until you walk a country mile in his shoes 
We're all in the same boat

Wondering where the same time goes

Take those shots and keep reloading 
If you can't be nice 
Don't say nothing at all 
So help somebody who might be struggling 
Spread a little love, gotta give back something 
If the ship keeps rocking 
We'll all go overboard

Wondering where the same time goes

"A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

When darkness comes 
And pain is all around

"I went with you up to
The place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to
""Walden"" it with you
Any longer, it would have got old

Singing ""Ace of Spades"" when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed
L.A.'s all right
Sleeping in my bed again
And getting in my head
And then walk around the reservoir

You, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

One of your eyes is always half-shut
Something happened when you were a kid
I didn't know you then
And I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did

""How Soon Is Now"" in an '80s sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song will creep you out until you're dead
 

And you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

I want to live at the Holiday Inn
Where somebody else makes the bed
We'll watch TV while the lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind since Bowie died
Just checking out to hide from life

And all of our problems
I'm gonna solve 'em
With you riding shot-gun
Speeding, 'cause fuck the cops

And you, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

"Someone asked me once in an interview
What was growing up like?
Where'd you go to school?
And what would you do
if you weren't doin' this?
I'd be drivin' my first car,
an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job,
just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar,
and an old barstool
I'd have a Friday night crowd
in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor,
couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like
I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin'
through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show
in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this
I'd still be the same guy
they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams
maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do

"I can think of all the times
You told me not to touch the light
I never thought that you would be the one
I couldn't really justify
How you even thought it could be right
Cause everything we cherished is gone
And in the end can you tell me if
It was worth the try, so I can decide

Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Oh you never really love someone until, you learn to forgive

Try as hard as I might
To flee the shadows of the night
It haunts me and it makes me feel blue
But how can I try to hide
When every breath and every hour
I still end up thinking of you
And in the end everything we have makes it worth the fight
So I will hold on for as long

As leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Ohh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive

I never thought that I would see the day
That I'd decide if I should leave or stay
But in the end what makes it worth the fight's
That no matter what happens we try to make it right

Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Wounds of the past will eventually heal
And all will be alright in time
'Cause all of this comes with a love that is real
I said all will be alright in time

The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then she calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand

Half of my high school fell in love with the girl next door
In their daddy's Ford

Of my hometown, they all got out

So stay or leave, part of me will always be

Half of them think that it ain't fair

The other half worries I'll just forget

Highways, they take us
Memories make us wanna go back
To our hometown, settle down

"Once the last drop
of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones
on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath,
reminds me of you
You find graffiti
on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off,
it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket,
it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been,
reminds me of me
I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your
""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air
I breathe reminds me of then
And I lived, and I learned,
had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount
of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me","Holly T, Liam Cole",Not With You
"Some days,
her shape in the doorway will speak to me
a bird's wing on the window. 

Sometimes I'll hear her
when she's sleeping
her fever dream a language on her face.

I want your flowers
like babies want God's love or
maybe as sure as tomorrow will come.

Some days,
like rain on the doorstep
she'll cover me with grace in all she offers.

Sometimes I'd like just to ask her
what honest words she can't afford to say like
I want your flowers,
like babies want God's love or
maybe as sure as tomorrow will come.",Lemaitre,Closer (Feat. Jennie A.)
"Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My mama's in the kitchen, worryin' about me
Seasons greetings, hope you're well
Well, I'm doing alright if you were wondering
Lately I can never tell
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine
I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And eveybody's here except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold
But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
Merry Christmas everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
Were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
You were mine",Starley,Call On Me
"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh (yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(Knew it right there)
So, shame on me now (knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh-oh

"You come over when your wine's all gone
Always catch me when I'm not that strong
Then you wind up staying all night long

You got a way of making me forget
Girl, with you the answer's always yes
Every time you call
But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Til you walk, 'til you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely, feeling like a fool, mm, mm
Every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you were running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you, but I do
Guess I love chasing after you, mm, mm, yeah
Listen
Wish I could quit you, but it feels too good
If I could turn it off, you know I would
But somethin' 'bout you makes me think we could
Make it after all
But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Til you walk, 'til you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely, feeling like a fool

That job, that smile, that might kiss you goodnight

So, take it easy on me now, won't ya?

You know what just gets to me every time

Saying I ain't gonna call, then I call

Now I'm in a car, driving too fast, going too far

That stupid love

Just when I thought I kicked that habit

You work a little midnight magic

And there I go again

Falling back in that stupid love, pulling me in like a boomerang

It's always the same damn thing

Can't get enough

Enough of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love

I hate the way I need ya when you're leaving

You come and go

You do just what you like, yeah

We break up just to make up

Slide your make up off the counter

Going back and forth for hours

Baby, I ain't got the power to fight

That stupid love

Just when I thought I kicked that habit

You work a little midnight magic

And there I go again

Falling back in that stupid love, pulling me in like a boomerang

It's always the same damn thing

Can't get enough

Enough of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love

That stupid love, love, love

That stupid love, love, love

Falling back into

You work a little midnight magic

And there I go again

Falling back in that stupid love, pulling me in like a boomerang

It's always the same damn thing

Can't get enough

Enough of that stupid lo-love, lo-love, lo-love, love, love, love

Can't get enough, can't get enough

"Said some things I ain't proud of
I wish I could take back
Never meant to make you hurt like that, no
For a while it was perfect
You made my world standstill
Oh, and something 'bout you always will
So when it's late at night and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends or you're lonely
When you hear somebody start to say my name
Oh, when you think of me
I hope you think good things
I hope you think, think good things
I hope you think, think good things
I hope you
Picture that night in Portland
We drank three bottles of wine
I said I love you 'bout a million times
And then we drove to Seattle
And just to kiss in the rain
Now when it's pourin', do you see my face?
So when it's late at night and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends or you're lonely (You're lonely)
When you hear somebody start to say my name
Oh, when you think of me
I hope you think good things
I hope you think, think good things
I hope you think, think good things I hope you
Think of the way that I started to shake when I held you for the first time
And every kiss that our lips made feel like New Year's Eve at midnight
Think of the 3 A.M. conversations, all of the big dreams that we were chasin' down
And if I ever cross your mind somehow
When it's late at night and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends or you're lonely
When you hear somebody start to say my name
Oh, when you think of me I hope you think good things",Cash Cash,Overtime

"[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red

"You're feeling nervous, aren't you, boy?
With your quiet voice and impeccable style
Don't ever let them steal your joy
And your gentle ways, to keep 'em from running wild
They can kick dirt in your face
Dress you down, and tell you that your place
Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine
I see you tugging on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
You get discouraged, don't you, girl?
It's your brother's world for a while longer
We gotta dance with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt in your face
To call you weak and then displace you
After carrying your baby on your back across the desert
I saw your eyes behind your hair
And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind

I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,
See you make your way through the crowd,
And say, ""Hello.""
Little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet.""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go.""
And I said,

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.""

So, I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So, close your eyes,
Escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh.

'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter.
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet.""
But you were everything to me.
I was begging you, ""Please don't go!""
And I said,

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.

Romeo, save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.""

Oh, oh, oh.

I got tired of waiting,
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading,
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said,

""Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you, but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said,

""Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress.

Baby, when you're lying in my arms

"Hey there it's been a while
You came out under the covers
With your smile so new
Yet it feels like old
So good to see you
Got a little sidetracked with hope
You'd gotten so used to
For what it's worth baby
Seeing you here
Is like seeing joy
But nothing gets by here
Yeah nothing gets by here
Break the rules
Am I a shoulder to cry on
Cause there was a time you left me with nothing to rely on
Save a place cause there's no more reason why
You gotta be a fool if you're thinking about saving face
Cause it's over it's over it's over this time
Nothing gets by here
Cause nothing gets by here
You had my heart
Such a delicate thing to break
You have a brand new life
What a life for your mistake
Cause nothing gets by here
Yeah nothing gets by here
Nothing gets by here
Nothing gets by here
Nothing gets by by here by here

"I cried a tear You wiped it dry
I was confused You cleared my mind
I sold my soul You bought it back for me
And held me up And gave me dignity
Some how you needed me

You gave me strength To stand alone again
To face the world Out on my own again
You put me high Upon a pedestal
So high that I Could almost see eternity
You needed me You needed me

And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you And you were there
And I'll never leave why should I leave I'd be a fool
Cause I've finally found Someone who really cares
You held my hand When it was cold
When I was lost You took me home
You gave me hope When I was at the end
And turned my lies Back into truth again
You even called me Friend

You gave me strength To stand alone again
To face the world Out on my own again
You put me high Upon a pedestal
So high that I Could almost see eternity
You needed me You needed me

And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you And you were there
And I'll never leave why should I leave I'd be a fool

Is come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home

Maybe surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home
Oh I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
″I'm fine baby, how are you?″
Well I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

Another sunny place
I'm lucky I know
But I wanna go home
Mmmm, I've got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home

And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
 Come along with me
But this was not your dream
But you always believe in me

Another winter day has come
 And gone away
And even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home

And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone

"I can't remember what I planned tomorrow
I can't remember when it's time to go
When I look in the mirror
Tracing lines with a pencil
I remember what came before

I wanted to think there was endless love
Until I saw the light dim in your eyes
In the dead of the night I found out
Sometimes there's love that won't survive

New York City
Such a beautiful disease
New York City
Such a beautiful,
Such a beautiful disease

Laura kept all her disappointments
Locked up in a box behind her closet door
She pulled the blinds and listened to the thunder
With no way out from the family store

We all told her things could get better
When you just say goodbye
I'll lay awake one more night
Caught in a vision I want to deny

And did I mention the note that I found
Taped to my locked front door
It talked about no regrets
As it slipped from my hand to the scuffed tile floor

I rode the train for hours on end
And watched the people pass me by
It could be that it has no end
Just an action junkie's lullaby

New York City
Such a beautiful disease
New York City
Such a beautiful,
Such a beautiful disease

We were full of the stuff that every dream rested
As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky
Caught up in the whole illusion
That dreams never pass us by
Came to a tattoed conclusion
That the big one was knocking on the door
What started as a mass delusion
Would take me far from the place I adore

New York City
You are my beautiful
Such a beautiful diasease",JAY Z,Empire State Of Mind

"Alone Again (Naturally) (With Michael Buble) - Diana Krall
In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to who
Ever what it's like when your shattered
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people 're saying
\""My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining
May as well go home.\""
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally
To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, well who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
And as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally
It seems to me that
There are more hearts
Broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?
Looking back over the years
What ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally",24KGoldn,Mood (Feat. iann dior)
"We skipped the light Fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
And the room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
But the waiter brought a tray
And so it was that later
As the Miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
You said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
Yet I wandered through my playing cards
And I would not, and I would not let it be
I'm one of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might, they might just as well have been closed
And so it was later
As the Miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
It turned a whiter, whiter shade
It turned a whiter shade of pale
It turned a whiter, whiter, whiter shade of pale
A whiter shade of pale
It turned a whiter shade of pale

Well this must be LA
Tired and lonely
With no real place to stay
Is this the future and where I'm gonna be?

When I had this crazy dream
Of waking up
In your house
On a san francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you and me

Just looking at a magazine
Like when I first saw you
Back in two thousand and three
Then you walked over
Said: ‘you don't have to be alone’
I don't have a crystal ball
There's no way that I could've known
(I'd be) waking up
In your house
On a san francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather

"Lovers tucked into a quiet cafe
Sat beneath a shade of red
They fall in love like falling out of bed
Half a silhouette of passer-bys
Have a glass within my hand
Drink to life as if there is no end
Maybe one day I will see you
Maybe one day I will see you soon
With love, my love
A kiss beneath the moon
River waking to the morning light
Lazy boats around the bend
Shimmers once or twice to move this pen
Beauty fades before thе mirrors when
Beauty knocks upon your door
Life is lеading us to something more
Maybe one day I will see you
Maybe one day I will see you soon
With love, my love
A kiss beneath the moon
Maybe one day I will see you
Maybe one day I will see you soon
With love, my love
A kiss beneath the moon

You won't admit you love me

You always tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

A million times I ask you
And then I ask you over again
But you only answer
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted, broken-hearted

So if you really love me, say yes
But if you don't, dear, confess

I try to give a party, and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life, just catching colds and missing trains

I never miss a thing, I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace, my partner always trumps
I guess I'm just a fool, who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet

Of with regret

To my monogram

Where is the shepherd
For this lost lamb?
There's a somebody
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he
Turns out to be
Someone to watch over me
I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one who'll watch over me
Although he may not
Be the man

As handsome to my heart
He carries the key
Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Why does this rain pour down Im gonna drown in a sea

Somebody told me, I don't know who
Whenever you are sad and blue
And you are feel in' all alone and left behind
Just take a look inside you and you will find


You goota hold on, hold on through the night
Hang on, things will be all right
Even when it's dark and not a bit of sparkling
Sing-song sunsine from above spreading rays of sunny love


Just Hang on, Hang on to the vine
Stay on, soon you'll be divine
If you start to cry, look up to the sky
Something's coming up ahead to turn your tears to dew instead

When change is hard and not so nice
If you listen to your heart the whole night through
Your sunny someday will come oneday soon to you","F.HERO, Milli",Mirror Mirror (Feat. Changbin of Stray Kids)

"Winter Wonderland - Tony Bennett, Lady GaGa
Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow
we can build a snowman
Then pretend
that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married?
We'll say no man
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow
we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun
with mister snowman
Until the other
kiddies knock him down
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a WINTER WONDERLAND!

"Look at me, Im as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like Im hanging from a cloud, I cant understand
I get misty, just holding your hand, walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear, I get misty the moment youre near
Don't you know that youre leading me on, 
and its just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
thats why Im following you
On my own, When I wander t
through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left, 
my hat from my glove
I'm too misty and too much in love
Too misty and too much in love",Nardo Wick,"Who Want Smoke?? (Feat. Lil Durk, 21 Savage)"

And since we've no place to go

And I've brought me some 
corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, 
we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm

I'd tell you what I'd do
I'd put the stars right in a jar and give 'em all to you

If the birds were mine
I'd tell them when to sing
I'd make them sing a sonnet when your telephone would ring
I would put them there inside the square, whenever you went out
so there'd always be sweet music whenever you would walk about
If the birds were mine
I'd tell you what I'd do
I'd teach the birds such lovely words and make 'em sing for you
I'd teach the birds such lovely words and make 'em sing for you

If the world was mine
I'd paint it gold and green
I'd make the oceans orange for a brilliant color scheme
I would color all the mountains, make the sky forever blue
So the world would be a painting and I'd live inside with you
If the world was mine
I'd tell you what I'd do
I'd wrap the world in ribbons and then give it all to you
I'd teach the birds such lovely words and make 'em sing for you
I'd put those stars right in a jar...and..........
give them all...to you.......

"How was I to know that this was always only just a little game to you?

All the time I felt you gave your heart I thought that I would do the same for you,

Tell the truth I think I should have seen it coming from a mile away,

When the words you say are, ""Baby I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love""

If I gave a thought to fascination,  I would know it wasn't right to care,

Logic doesn't seem to mind that I am fascinated by the love affair,


Still my heart would benefit from a little tenderness from time to time, but never mind,




Cos Baby I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love,

Baby I should hold on just a moment and be sure it's not for vanity,

Look me in the eye and tell me love is never based upon insanity,

Hear the way my heart is beating every other moments fleeting,

Kiss me now,

Don't ask me how,

Cos Baby I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall,

Baby I'm a fool who thinks it's cool to fall,

And I would never tell if you became a fool and fell in Love.",Gym Class Heroes,Stereo Hearts (Feat. Adam Levine of Maroon 5)
